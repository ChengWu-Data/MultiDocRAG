These standard methodologies enable a complete understanding of inflation-adjusted bonds, inflation swaps, inflation futures, and more complex inflation derivatives. Given this theory, the empirical literature primarily uses these models to estimate both the expected inflation rate over various future horizons and the inflation risk premium.Expected in- flation rates are useful for central banks in their formulation of monetary policy.Estimates of the inflation risk premium are beneficial to governments in deciding whether to finance government deficits by issuing either nominal or inflation-adjusted bonds. For example, if the inflation risk premium is positive, then issuing inflation-adjusted bonds that reflect", "either nominal or inflation-adjusted bonds. For example, if the inflation risk premium is positive, then issuing inflation-adjusted bonds that reflect no inflation risk premium provides a cheaper borrowing instrument than issuing nominal bonds. In addition, if there is a positive inflation risk premium, then by helping to complete the market, investors’ welfares are improved by the issuance of inflation-adjusted bonds. Surprisingly, a related empirical literature eitherinvestigatingtheefficiencyoftheinflationderivativemarketsorprovidingacomparisonof the valuation models is almost nonexistent and a fruitful area for future research.

Even in low and stable inflationary periods, the low volatility of real returns and their low correlation with other asset returns make them attractive for portfolio diversification.

However, this is typically not the case, because infla- tion indices are computed with a lag. For example, in the United States, the inflation-adjusted 1Historically, real estate was considered a good inflation hedge, but recent evidence is mixed in this regard (Hoesli,Lizieri & MacGregor 2008). 450 Jarrow  Yildirim Annu.

There is a 2- to 3-month lag in compiling the CPI.Therefore,to approximate the actual realized inflation,daily CPI levels are linearly extrapolated to create realized daily adjustments. Currently, 20 countries regularly issue inflation-adjusted bonds, and the total notional vol- umeinFebruary2022wasapproximately4.4trilliondollars(Ranasinghe,Chatterjee&Barbuscia 2022).

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States issued the earliest recorded inflation-indexed bonds in 1780 during the Revolutionary War (see Shiller 2005). Modern gov- ernments began issuing inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) much later,spurred on by high inflation in conjunction with regulatory and tax changes. Inthe1980s,aperiodofhighinflation,theUnitedKingdomwasamajorissuerofthesebonds. With the UK pension reform of 1984, pension companies became the leading investors in these securities to mitigate unexpectedly large inflation.In the late 1990s,more countries stepped into the market.

Withthe reformoftax-exemptsaving accountsinFrance,theFrenchinflation-linkedObligation Assimilable du Tresor (OATi) was launched in 1998. Later, Italy in 2003, Germany in 2005, and others in Europe issued such bonds linked to the European Monetary Union Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (EMU HICP).Following the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) and the US Con- sumer Price Index (CPI), EMU HICP is the third major index for inflation securities.

The US federal government offers another type of inflation-adjusted bond called a US Series I Saving Bond. To determine the interest paid on TIPS, the interest calculations are based upon an inflation-adjusted principal using the CPI-U. The principal of a TIPS bond increases with inflationanddecreaseswithdeflation,althoughitcanneverfallbelowthebond’soriginalprincipal. In this regard, the bond embeds an inflation put option.

However, the embedded put option has had little value (if any), since the CPI-U has continuously increased [similarly, the embedded call option has little value with CPI-U decreases (see Jarrow & Yildirim 2003)]. In contrast, the earnings rate of a Series I Bond is determined as the sum of a fixed rate of return,set at the time of purchase, and a variable semiannual inflation rate. TIPS are issued with 5-, 10-, and 30-year maturities,while the Series I Bonds only have a 30-year maturity. TIPS can be purchased online through Treasury Direct, a website run by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service under the US Department of the Treasury,or over-the-counter through a bank or broker.BothTIPSandUSSeriesIBondsaresubjecttofederaltax", "he Fiscal Service under the US Department of the Treasury,or over-the-counter through a bank or broker.BothTIPSandUSSeriesIBondsaresubjecttofederaltaxbutexemptfromstateandlocal income taxes. However, they differ in the timing of federal tax payment; the semiannual interest payments and inflation adjustments that increase the principal of TIPS are subject to federal tax in the year that they occur, while the tax reporting of interest payments can be deferred until redemption or final maturity for the Series I Bonds.2 The connection between the nominal yield (i.e., conventional bond yield) and the real yield (i.e., the yield in excess of expected inflation) is through the Fisher equation, as discussed in Section 5.

Although the UK market introduced the first inflation derivatives after the gilt repo market began in 1996, the larger market growth did not start until after 2003. In the global market, the traded notional volume of inflation swaps in 2021 hit a record $1.67 trillion, increasing by 37% from $1.21 trillion in 2020.

On a broader level, the Interest Rate Derivatives (IRD) traded notional and trade count grew by 0.5% and 19.5%, respectively, in 2021 versus the year before.Based on the January 2022 report by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA),the IRD traded notionalvalue increased to$231.0 trillionin 2021 from$229.7 trillionin 2020,while the trade count rose to 1.9 million from 1.6 million over the same period (Int.Swaps Deriv.Assoc.2022).

Many kinds of inflation derivatives are available over-the-counter, such as inflation swaps, in- flation options, inflation-adjusted bond options, inflation-linked equity, inflation-linked equity options, inflation-linked credit default swaps, and inflation-linked collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).We now describe the common inflation derivatives and their uses for hedging purposes. 3.1. Inflation Swaps There are two main inflation-adjusted swaps traded in the market: the zero-coupon and the year- on-year swaps (Benaben & Goldenberg 2008,Brigo & Mercurio 2006). A zero-coupon inflation swap is simply a forward rate contract on the future inflation rate. Protectionbuyers(e.g.,pensionfunds)a", "go & Mercurio 2006).

A year-on-year inflation swap is an agreement to exchange fixed-rate payments against inflation-adjusted coupon payments every year, instead of the one-time exchange of cash flows at the maturity, as in the case of a zero-coupon inflation swap. The fixed rate is the quoted rate. The hedging uses are the same as for the zero-coupon i", "he maturity, as in the case of a zero-coupon inflation swap. The fixed rate is the quoted rate. The hedging uses are the same as for the zero-coupon inflation swap. 3.2.

THE BASIC VALUATION MODEL Todiscussvaluationandhedging,weconstructageneralarbitrage-freemarketusingtheFXanal- ogy introduced by Jarrow & Yildirim (2003). We consider a continuous trading and continuous time model on the finite intervalt ∈ [0,T ],where T denotes the model’s horizon.We are given a complete filtered probability space (/Omega1,F,F,P), where the filtrationF = (Ft)t∈[0,T ] satisfies the usual hypotheses andF = FT .4", ".We are given a complete filtered probability space (/Omega1,F,F,P), where the filtrationF = (Ft)t∈[0,T ] satisfies the usual hypotheses andF = FT .4 Here, P is the statistical probability measure. By the statistical probability measureP,we mean that from which historical time series data are generated (drawn by nature). Hence, standard statistical methods can be used to estimate this probability measure P from historical time series data. Traded in a frictionless and competitive market are nominal and inflation-protected zero- coupon bonds of all maturities and a nominal money market account (details provided in Section 4.1).By frictionless,we mean that there are no transaction costs,there are no differential taxes, shares are infinitely divisible, and there are no trading constraints (e.", "we mean that there are no transaction costs,there are no differential taxes, shares are infinitely divisible, and there are no trading constraints (e.g., short sales restric- tions,borrowinglimits,ormarginrequirements).Bycompetitive,wemeanthattradersactasprice takers, i.e., they can trade any quantity of shares desired without affecting the market price. Al- ternatively stated,there is no liquidity risk.Liquidity risk is when there is a quantity impact from trading on the price (for additional discussion,see Cetin,Jarrow & Protter 2004). 4.1.

The first fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that the market satisfies no free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) if and only if there exists an equivalent local martingale measureQ for the traded zero-coupon bonds,i.e., P n(t,T) B(t) , PI(t,T) B(t) for all 0≤ t ≤ T ≤ T are Q - loca", "e exists an equivalent local martingale measureQ for the traded zero-coupon bonds,i.e., P n(t,T) B(t) , PI(t,T) B(t) for all 0≤ t ≤ T ≤ T are Q - local martingales.

Formally, this implies thatQ and P are related by a density processdQ dP via the re- lation Q = dQ dPP.This relation gives the densitydQ dP the interpretation of a risk premium for both real and inflation risk.Q is typically called a risk-neutral probability.Note that conditional expec- tationofthedensity EP t (dQ dP ) =: dQ dP (t)isa P martingalewhere EP 0 (dQ dP ) = dQ dP (0) = 1because Q isa probability.The ratio dQ dP (t) B(t) is called the state price density becausePn(t,T) dQ dP (t) B(t) and PI(t,T) dQ dP (t) B(t) are P ma", "because Q isa probability.The ratio dQ dP (t) B(t) is called the state price density becausePn(t,T) dQ dP (t) B(t) and PI(t,T) dQ dP (t) B(t) are P martingales,implying that it is an adjustment for both risk and discounting. A local martingale is a martingale on a sequence of stopping times approachingT , a modest generalization of a martingale that allows for the existence of price bubbles in an NFLVR market [for more discussion,see Jarrow (2021,chapter 3)]. www.annualreviews.org  Inflation-AdjustedBonds,Swaps,andDerivatives 455 Annu.

Sufficientconditionsforthesatisfactionofmarketcompleteness,onceevolutionsforthenominal and inflation protected bonds are given,are provided below. There is some debate in the literature regarding whether the term structure of interest rate evolution has unspanned volatility, i.e., whether the interest rate market is complete due to stochastic volatility. The evidence is mixed (see, e.g., Bikbov & Chernov 2009; Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein & Jon", "terest rate market is complete due to stochastic volatility. The evidence is mixed (see, e.g., Bikbov & Chernov 2009; Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein & Jones 2009; Li & Zhao 2006).The problem with many of these studies rejecting the spanned volatility hypothesis is that they exogenously fix the number of factors in their estima- tion methodology (usually assuming there are up to three factors).Fixing the number of factors a priori can misspecify the model and bias the tests against accepting stochastic volatility and mar- ket completeness.If the market is incomplete,then unique valuation of interest rate and inflation derivatives using the methodology discussed next fails (see Jarrow 2021,chapter 8).

As noted, however, the procedure just described only gives a finite collection of zero-coupon bond prices corresponding to the coupon payment dates underlying the collection of coupon bonds used in the estimation. To price various inflation derivatives, it is desired to obtain the implied zero-coupon bond prices for the entire continuum of maturities between timetand T . This procedure is called term structure smoothing. The techniques for smoothing the nominal term structure of interest rates are well-known, and these techniques can be employed to obtain boththeinflation-adjustedandrealzero-couponbondpricecurves.Weleaveadiscussionofthese smoothing techniques to the existing literature (for a review,see Jarrow 2014). 7.

The Empirical Evidence The above construction implies that in an arbitrage-free, frictionless, and competitive market the synthetic default-free nominal coupon bond should cost the same to construct as the traded default-free nominal coupon bond. Fleckenstein, Longstaff & Lustig (2014) investigated this equivalence using US Treasury securities from July 2004 and November 2009. They found that the two prices were significantly different and explored which market frictions could explain the difference. They concluded that they could not really explain the difference using the standard market frictions. 9.

The cap’s start date is time 0. The maturity date of the cap isτ, and its notional value is 1 n.

As seen,the caplet earns the difference between the inflation rate over the time period [T− δ,T] and the strike rateκ times the notional value 1n and is prorated byδ,but only if this difference is strictly positive. Its timetarbitrage-free value,denotedc(t,T: κ,δ),is given by c(t,T : κ,δ) = EQ t ⎡ ⎣ max [( I(T) I(T−δ) − 1 ) − κ,0 ] 1nδ B(T) ⎤ ⎦B(t), using the equivalent martingale probabilityQ,orby c(t,T : κ,δ) = Pn(t,T)EQT t [ max [( I(T) I(T − δ) − 1 ) − κ,0 ] 1nδ ] , using the forward martingale probabilityQT.

An inflation-indexed floor with the same characteristics {1n, τ, κ, δ} is defined similarly, ex- cept that its payoffs correspond to those from a collection of inflation-indexed floorlets.

Similarly, arbitrage-free valuation formulas hold as for the caplets. Given specific evolutions as in Section 4.4, explicit analytic formulas are available for caps and floors (Hinnerich 2008; Ho, Huang & Yildirim 2014; Mercurio 2005). 9.2.

As docu- mented,the theoretical literature is quite mature,utilizing the existing theories developed in the term structure literature. Empirically, to date, the application of these insights has mainly fo- cused on computing expected inflation rates and inflation risk premiums to help guide monetary policy decision-making. The applications of these insights to the valuation and hedging of infla- tion derivatives and to understanding the efficiency of the inflation derivative markets are open research questions,yet to be investigated.

INTRODUCTION The term structure of interest rates literature studies the evolution of default-free interest rates of different maturities (the term structure) across time. Alternatively stated, the term structure of interest rates studies the evolution of default-free bond prices of different maturities. There are two related a", "tively stated, the term structure of interest rates studies the evolution of default-free bond prices of different maturities. There are two related approaches to understanding this evolution: equilibrium and arbitrage-free pricing models. Equilibrium models are more complex, requiring more assumptions about investor preferences and market structures. This additional structure enables equilibrium models to characterize interest rate risk premia or, equivalently, the expected returns on zero- coupon bonds of all maturities (the price evolution under the statistical probability mea- sure). To test these models, one needs to estimate the interest rate risk premia because these differentiate the various models. In contrast, complete market arbitrage-free pricing models study the evolution of t", "t rate risk premia because these differentiate the various models. In contrast, complete market arbitrage-free pricing models study the evolution of the term structure of interest rates to price interest rate derivatives given the initial prices for a collection of zero-coupon bonds. For this reason, the arbitrage-free pricing methodology is often termed a relative pricing theory. The arbitrage-free pricing models are also useful for understanding interest rate risk management, in particular the hedging of interest rate risk. These models are valid for arbitrary interest rate risk premia; hence, they are consistent with numerous equilibrium models. To test these models, one needs to estimate only volatilities and correlations of default-free interest rates and validate (or reject) the mode", "odels. To test these models, one needs to estimate only volatilities and correlations of default-free interest rates and validate (or reject) the model’s hedging accuracy. Although the term structure of interest rates literature in financial economics investi- gates both equilibrium and arbitrage-free pricing models, this paper concentrates on the arbitrage-free pricing approach because it is unique to financial economics, whereas equi- librium models are not. This paper focuses on the theory relating to the term structure of interest rates, which is in a relatively mature state, as evidenced by the numerous text- books on the topic (see Baxter & Rennie 1996, Brigo & Mercurio 2001, Jarrow 2002, Musiela & Rutkowski 2004, Rebonato 2002, Schoenmakers 2005, and Zagst 2002).

The empirical literature is discussed only briefly; a detailed presentation is left for a subsequent paper. An outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a historical overview of the financial economics literature on the term structure of interest rates. Section 3 provides the preliminaries for the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model that is presented in Section 4. Section 5 studies forward and futures contracts, a topic that is only interesting if interest rates are stochastic. Section 6 investigates the traditional expectations hypothesis, and Section 7 the prices caps and floors using the London InterBank Offer Rates (LIBOR) model. Section 8 briefly di", "aditional expectations hypothesis, and Section 7 the prices caps and floors using the London InterBank Offer Rates (LIBOR) model. Section 8 briefly discusses the empirical evidence, and Section 9 talks about the application of term structure models to related topics. Section 10 concludes the review with a discussion on topics for future research. All significant proofs are contained in an appendix (Section 11). 2. A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW In arbitrage-free pricing models, the term structure of interest rates literature involves the study of using derivatives to hedge (risk-manage) the financial risks generated by the evolution of default-free interest rates of different maturities.

The first is government debt issued by countries whose national balance sheets imply that default is highly unlikely, examples being the United States, Germany, Great Britain, and Japan. Government debt is studied in its domestic currency, excluding foreign currency exchange considerations. The second is borrowing/lending of U.S. dollars of different maturities in the Eurodollar market. 1 The Eurodollar market consists of U.S. dollars deposited into European banks that operate outside the U.S. banking system’s reserve requirements. As such, Eurodollar interest rates ar", "U.S. dollars deposited into European banks that operate outside the U.S. banking system’s reserve requirements. As such, Eurodollar interest rates are less subject to the supply impacts of the U.S. Treasury auction cycle and the direct impact of U.S. monetary policy. Eurodollar borrowing/lending is nearly default free due to the credit quality of the banks involved and the existence of collateral agreements between the relevant counterparties. The study of using derivatives to hedge financial risks really began with the publication of the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model (Black & Scholes 1973, Merton 1973). The BSM model assumes deterministic interest rates. 2 This assumption best applies to short-dated equity and foreign currency options where deterministic interest rates", "es deterministic interest rates. 2 This assumption best applies to short-dated equity and foreign currency options where deterministic interest rates are a reasonable approximation. The discovery of the BSM technology facilitated the expansion of these option markets by enabling the hedging (risk management) of equity and foreign currency risks. Prior to the 1970s, interest rates were relatively low and stable, so managing interest rate risk was less of a market concern. However, in the 1970s and the 1980s, due to double-digit inflation and the shift from fixed to floating currency exchange rates, interest rates became large and volatile. This increased interest rate risk generated a demand for tools and financial securities to help manage these risks. This demand led to the emergence of t", "s increased interest rate risk generated a demand for tools and financial securities to help manage these risks. This demand led to the emergence of the over-the-counter interest rate derivatives market with the introduction of the first interest rate swap in late 1981. 3 New interest rate risk management tools were needed because the BSM model was not well designed for this application. Assuming deterministic interest rates, the BSM model applies less well to long-dated contracts (greater than a year or two) and for short-dated contracts where the underlying asset’s price process is highly correlated with interest rate movements. This, of course, is the case for interest rate derivatives, where the underlying assets are the interest rates themselves. In response, a class of equilibrium-ba", "urse, is the case for interest rate derivatives, where the underlying assets are the interest rates themselves. In response, a class of equilibrium-based interest rate pricing models was developed by Merton (1970), Vasicek (1977), Brennan & Schwartz (1979), and Cox et al. (1985); the latter is known as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. This class of models, known as spot rate models, had two limitations. First, they depended on the interest rate risk premia or, equivalently, the expected return on default-free bonds. This dependence, just as with the option pricing models pre-BSM, made their implementation problematic. Indeed, the estimation of risk premia is very difficult. The reason for this difficulty is that the empiri- cal finance literature has documented that risk premia are nons", "n of risk premia is very difficult. The reason for this difficulty is that the empiri- cal finance literature has documented that risk premia are nonstationary. They vary across time according to both changing tastes and changing economic fundamentals. This non- stationarity makes problematic both the modeling of risk premia and their estimation. 1The BSM model is the formula in the Black & Scholes (1973) paper. Merton (1973) also extended this formula to allow for a stochastic interest rate by including a single zero-coupon bond, whose maturity date matches that of the call option. This extension, however, did not introduce an entire term structure of interest rates into the valuation methodology. 2There is also an analog to Eurodollar markets in alternative currencies, known as Eurocurre", "ructure of interest rates into the valuation methodology. 2There is also an analog to Eurodollar markets in alternative currencies, known as Eurocurrencies, e.g., Euroyen. 3See Fabozzi (2000, p.585). www.annualreviews.org /C15 The Term Structure of Interest Rates71 Annu.

Indeed, at present, there is still no generally accepted model for an asset’s risk premium that is consistent with historical data (see Cochrane 2001). Second, these models could not easily match the initial yield curve. This calibration is essential for the accurate pricing and hedging of interest rate derivatives because any discrepancies in yield curve matching may indicate false arbitrage opport", "or the accurate pricing and hedging of interest rate derivatives because any discrepancies in yield curve matching may indicate false arbitrage opportunities in the priced derivatives. To address these limitations, Ho & Lee (1986) applied a binomial option pricing model to interest rate derivatives with a twist. Instead of imposing an evolution on the spot rate, they had the zero-coupon bond price curve evolve in a binomial tree. This was a complete market model; that is, there were enough zero-coupon bond prices trading to hedge all interest rate risk. Risk premia are not necessary to price interest rate derivatives in a complete market setting. Motivated by this paper, Heath et al. (1992) generalized this idea in the context of a continuous time and multifactor-complete market model, ter", "ing. Motivated by this paper, Heath et al. (1992) generalized this idea in the context of a continuous time and multifactor-complete market model, termed the HJM model. The key step in the derivation of the HJM model was determining necessary and sufficient condi- tions for an arbitrage-free evolution of the term structure of interest rates. To simplify the mathematics (although this is not necessary), Heath et al. focused on forward rates instead of zero-coupon bond prices. The martingale pricing technology of Harrison & Kreps (1979) and Harrison & Pliska (1981, 1983) was the tool used to obtain the desired conditions—the HJM arbitrage-free drift conditions. Given the HJM drift conditions and the fact that the interest rate market is complete, standard techniques then apply to price inter", "drift conditions. Given the HJM drift conditions and the fact that the interest rate market is complete, standard techniques then apply to price interest rate derivatives. The HJM model is very general: All previous spot rate models are special cases. In fact, the labels Ho & Lee, Vasicek, extended Vasicek (or sometimes Hull & White 1990), and CIR are now exclusively used to identify subclasses of the HJM model. Subclasses are uniquely identified by a particular volatility structure for the forward rate curve’s evolu- tion. For example, the Ho & Lee (1986) model is now identified as a single factor HJM model where the forward rate volatility is a constant across maturities. Subsequent research developed special cases of the HJM model that have nice analytic and computational properties for", "is a constant across maturities. Subsequent research developed special cases of the HJM model that have nice analytic and computational properties for implementation. Perhaps the most useful class, for its analytic properties, is the affine model of Duffie & Kan (1996) and Dai & Singleton (2003). The class of models is known as affine because the spot rate can be written as an affine function of a given set of state variables. This class of term structure evolutions have known characteristic functions for the spot rate, which enables numerical computations for various interest rate derivatives (see Duffie et al. 2000). Extensions of the affine class include Filipovic´ (2002), Chen et al. (2004), and Cheng & Scaillet (2007). The original HJM paper showed that lognormally distributed instant", "e class include Filipovic´ (2002), Chen et al. (2004), and Cheng & Scaillet (2007). The original HJM paper showed that lognormally distributed instantaneous forward rates are inconsistent with no arbitrage. Hence, geometric Brownian motion is excluded as an acceptable forward rate process. This is unfortunate because it implies that caplets, options on forward rates, will not satisfy Black’s equation (Black 1976). And historically, because of the industry’s familiarity with the BSM formula (a close relative of Black’s formula), Black’s formula was used extensively to value caplets. This inconsistency be- tween theory and practice led to a search for a theoretical justification for using Black’s formula with caplets. This search was ended by Sandmann et al. (1995), Miltersen et al. (1997),", "rch for a theoretical justification for using Black’s formula with caplets. This search was ended by Sandmann et al. (1995), Miltersen et al. (1997), and Brace et al. (1997). The solution was to use a simple interest rate, compounded discretely. Of course, simple rates better match practice. Also, it was shown that the evolution of a simple interest rate can evolve as a geometric Brownian motion in an arbitrage-free setting. 72 Jarrow Annu. Rev. Fin. Econ. 2009.1:69-96.

This subclass of the HJM model comprises what are known as the LIBOR models, after their application to LIBOR. Subsequently, the lognormal evolution has been extended to jump diffusions (see Glasserman & Kou 2003), Levy processes", "ter their application to LIBOR. Subsequently, the lognormal evolution has been extended to jump diffusions (see Glasserman & Kou 2003), Levy processes (see Eberlein & Ozkan 2005), and stochastic volatilities (see Andersen & Brotherton-Ratcliffe 2001), which brings us to the current literature on interest rate term structure models. Just as the option pricing models played a key role in enabling the expansion of the equity, foreign currency, and commodity option markets, the term structure of interest rate models played a key role in enabling the expansion of fixed income markets. This includes the over-the-counter interest rate derivative markets (swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, etc.), asset-backed security markets (mortgages—residential and commercial; loans—corporate, student, car, and c", "kets (swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, etc.), asset-backed security markets (mortgages—residential and commercial; loans—corporate, student, car, and credit cards; etc.), and the credit derivative markets (default swaps, collateralized default obligations, etc.). Derivative pricing models enable financial expan- sion because they provide the tools for risk management—the hedging of financial risks. Hedging facilitates the creation of two-sided markets via enabling a financial intermediary to synthetic-construct, the opposite side to a one-sided financial market. This expansion of financial derivative markets, through the efficient allocation of capital, has had positive and real effects on economic growth. 3.

We refer to a market constructed above an interest rate market model. This model applies best to two markets. The first is government debt issued by countries with national balance sheets where default is highly unlikely, examples being the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, and the second is borrowing/lending of U.S. dollars of different maturities in the Eurodollar market. Eurodollar borrowing/lend- ing is nearly default free due to the existence of collateral agreements between the relevant counter parties. The frictionless and competitive markets assumptions are a good first approximation for these markets. 4. ARBITRAGE-FREE TERM STRUCTURE MODELS The arbitrage-free interest rat", "petitive markets assumptions are a good first approximation for these markets. 4. ARBITRAGE-FREE TERM STRUCTURE MODELS The arbitrage-free interest rate term structure methodology is known as the HJM model (Heath et al. 1992). The HJM model starts by assuming an evolution for the term struc- ture of interest rates. Although unnecessary, for simplicity of computation, they select the forward rate curve. In particular, the HJM model assumes that we are given an initial forward rate curve, fð0; TÞ for 0/C20 t /C20 T /C20 t; and a stochastic process for the evolution of the forward rate curve, fðt; TÞ¼ fð0; TÞþ Z t 0 aðs; TÞdt þ Xn i¼1 Z t 0 siðs; TÞdWiðsÞ for 0/C20 t /C20 T /C20 t; ð2Þ where Wi(t) for i =1 ,... n are independent standard Brownian motions adapted to ðF tÞt2½0;t/C138 , anda(t, T", "TÞdWiðsÞ for 0/C20 t /C20 T /C20 t; ð2Þ where Wi(t) for i =1 ,... n are independent standard Brownian motions adapted to ðF tÞt2½0;t/C138 , anda(t, T) andsi(t, T) fori =1 ,... n are ðFtÞt2½0;t/C138 adapted, suitably measurable and integrable, so that expression 2 is well defined (see Heath et al. 1992).4 In differential form, this is dfðt; TÞ¼ aðt; TÞdt þ Xn i¼1 siðt; TÞdWiðtÞ: ð3Þ This in an n – factor model for the forward rate evolution. Then – factors represent distinct economic forces affecting forward rates (e.g., inflation, unemployment, economic growth). Expression 2 represents a very general stochastic process. 5 Indeed, the evolution need not be Markov (in a finite number of state variables) and can be path dependent. In addition, given that the interest rate market model does n", "on need not be Markov (in a finite number of state variables) and can be path dependent. In addition, given that the interest rate market model does not have currency trading (only zero-coupon bonds and a money market account), forward rates can be negative. To exclude negative forward rates, an additional restriction needs to be imposed on the evolution in expression 2. 4For this paper, we do not emphasize the technical conditions needed for the subsequent expressions to exist. The interested reader is referred to the original publications for these details. 5In fact, the only substantive economic restriction in expression 2 is that the process has continuous sample paths; however, this restriction is also unnecessary. 74 Jarrow Annu.

Arbitrage-Free Conditions From Harrison & Pliska (1981), the interest rate market model is arbitrage free if and only if there exists a probability measureQ equivalent toP such thatpðt;TÞ BðtÞ is aQ/C0 martingale for allT. Equivalent means that bothQ and P agree on zero-probability events in the set F .

This is known as the HJM arbitrage-free drift condition. The proof of the HJM arbitrage-free drift condition is contained in the appendix (Section 11). If the traded zero-coupon bonds reflect systematic risk, then the risk premia will be nonnegative; that is, f i(t) /C21 0. This is the typical situation. www.annualreviews.org /C15 The Term Structure of Interest Rates75 Annu. Rev. Fin. Econ. 2009.1:69-96.

It is important to emphasize that the HJM arbitrage-free drift condition shows that not all forward rate curve evolutions are consistent with an arbitrage-free economy. In fact, as shown in the original paper by Heath et al. 1992, an evolution inconsistent with an arbitrage-free interest rate economy is geometric Brownian motion, namely dfðt; TÞ¼ aðt; TÞdt þ sfðt; TÞdW t; ð9Þ where s is a constant. It was shown that, under geometric Brownian motion, forward rates explode with positive probability over any finite interval, implying zero-coupon bond prices have zero value (and, hence, arbitrage exists). In an arbitrage-free interest rate market model, pðt;TÞ BðtÞ being a Q – martingale implies that pðs; TÞ BðsÞ ¼ ~Et pðt; TÞ BðtÞ /C18/C19 for s /C20 t; ð10Þ whe", "trage-free interest rate market model, pðt;TÞ BðtÞ being a Q – martingale implies that pðs; TÞ BðsÞ ¼ ~Et pðt; TÞ BðtÞ /C18/C19 for s /C20 t; ð10Þ where ~Et /C1ðÞ denotes expectation under the martingale measureQ. From an economic perspective, this is equivalent to pðt; TÞ¼ ~Etðe/C0 RT t rsdsÞ: ð11Þ This expression states that the price of a zero-coupon bond is equal to its expected discounted payoff, where the discount rate is the spot rate of interest. Because the discount rate contains no adjustment for risk, this approach is often called risk-neutral valuation. Indeed, expression 11 is the equilibrium price that would exist in an interest rate market model where all investors are risk neutral and have beliefs represented byQ (and notP). In essence, the risk premia are embedded in the e", "rate market model where all investors are risk neutral and have beliefs represented byQ (and notP). In essence, the risk premia are embedded in the expectations operator when computing present values, and not in the discount rate. 6 To understand this statement, it can be shown via Girsanov’s theorem (see Protter 2005) that the equivalent martingale probabili- ty measureQ relates to the statistical probability measureP via the expression dQ dP ¼ e Pn i¼1 Rt 0 fiðsÞdWiðsÞ/C0 1 2 Pn i¼1 Rt 0 fiðsÞ2ds : ð12Þ The difference between the statistical and martingale probability measures reflects the interest rate risk premia {f1(t),... , fn (t)}. If all the risk premium were identically zero, then the two probability measures would be equal; that is,Q = P. We return to this issue below when we di", "all the risk premium were identically zero, then the two probability measures would be equal; that is,Q = P. We return to this issue below when we discuss the traditional expectations hypotheses. 4.2. Complete Markets Harrison & Pliska (1981, 1983) proved that an arbitrage-free market is complete if and only if the martingale measureQ is unique. For an interest rate market model, a complete market is one where any random payoff desired at a future date, based on the information 6In finance textbooks, a present value formula is often written aspðt; TÞ¼ Et e/C0 RT t ðrs þysÞds /C18/C19 , where ys is a risk premium adjustment to the discount rate and Et(/C1 ) is the expectation using the statistical probability P. The arbitrage-free pricing methodology adjusts the expectations operator and n", "te and Et(/C1 ) is the expectation using the statistical probability P. The arbitrage-free pricing methodology adjusts the expectations operator and not the discount rate. Alternatively, rewriting pðt; TÞ¼ Et 1/C1 dQ dP hi e/C0 RT t rs ds /C18/C19 , one can view the change of measure as equivalent to computing a certainty equivalent. 76 Jarrow Annu. Rev. Fin.

In essence, there exists a set of zero- coupon bonds {T1,... , Tn} that span the randomness generated by the n/C0 Brownian motions. A complete market enables unique pricing of interest rate derivatives. Indeed, Harrison & Pliska (1981, 1983) also showed that in a complete market, any suitably measurable and integrable random payoff received at timeT, denoted XT, will have a timet value equal to Xt ¼ ~EtðXT e/C0 RT t rsdsÞ: ð14Þ As with expression 11, the arbi", "grable random payoff received at timeT, denoted XT, will have a timet value equal to Xt ¼ ~EtðXT e/C0 RT t rsdsÞ: ð14Þ As with expression 11, the arbitrage-free pricing methodology is termed risk-neutral valuation because the current value equals the discounted expected payoffs, where the discount rate equals the default-free spot rate of interest. The adjustment for risk is incorporated into the expectation operator and not the discount rate. The random payoff in expression 14 could represent the cash flows from an interest rate swap, cap, floor, or any other European-style interest rate derivative. A European- style interest rate derivative’s cash flows are determined by the contract’s specification, not by any decisions of the holder or seller. 7 American-style interest rate derivative", "’s cash flows are determined by the contract’s specification, not by any decisions of the holder or seller. 7 American-style interest rate derivative contract provisions require active decisions by either the holder or the seller. Using standard techniques (see Musiela & Rutkowski 2004), the arbitrage-free valuation formula in expression 14 can be extended to American-style interest rate derivatives as well. Hedging based on expression 14 follows in the standard manner. For ann – factor model, anyn zero-coupon bonds satisfying the matrix condition (Equation 13) can be used to hedge the value processX t in expression 14. In special cases, the hedge ratios can be determined using Ito’s lemma (or its generalizations, see Protter 2005).

Refinements With respect to understanding the mathematical structure of HJM models, three questions exist. First, what structures guarantee that interest rates remain positive? Second, given an initial forward rate curve and its evolution, what is the class of forward rate curves that can be generated by all possible evolutions? Third, under what conditions is an HJM model a finite-dimensional Markov process? The first question was answered by Flesaker & Hughston (1996), Rogers (1994), and Jin & Glasserman (2001). The second was solved by Bjork & Christensen (1999) and Filipovic´ (2001). The third was studied", "(1996), Rogers (1994), and Jin & Glasserman (2001).

The third was studied by Cheyette (1992), Caverhill (1994), Jeffrey (1995), Duffie & Kan (1996), and Bjork & Svensson (2001), among others. The original HJM model had the term structure of interest rates generated by a finite number of Brownian motions. Extensions include (a) jump processes (see Jarrow & Madan 1995, Bjork et al. 1997, and Eberlein & Raible 1999), (b) stochastic volatilities (see Chiarella & Kwon 2000 and Andersen & Brotherton-Ratcliffe 2001), and (c) random fields (see Kennedy 1994, Goldstein 2000, and Santa-Clara & Sornette 2001). 5.

FORWARD AND FUTURES CONTRACTS Stochastic term structure of interest rate models are essential for understanding forward and futures contracts and prices because, as first shown in the classical literature by Jarrow & Oldfield (1981) and Cox et al. (1981b), there is no economic difference between these two contract types unless interest rates are stochastic. 5.1. Forward Contracts Consider an asset with timet price S(t) that is adapted to the filtrationðF tÞt2½0;t/C138 . This implies that the asset’s randomness is that generated by the evolution of the term structure of interest rates. For example, the asset could be a zero-coupon bond.

A forward contract obligates the owner (long position) to buy the asset on the delivery date T for a predetermined price. This price is set, by market convention, such that the value of the forward contract at initiation is zero. This market clearing price is termed the forward price and denotedK(t, T). Assuming that the asset has no cash flows over the life of the forward contract, an arbitrage-free forward price must equal Kðt; TÞ¼ SðtÞ pðT; tÞ : ð19Þ Proof: The payoff to a forward", "sh flows over the life of the forward contract, an arbitrage-free forward price must equal Kðt; TÞ¼ SðtÞ pðT; tÞ : ð19Þ Proof: The payoff to a forward contract at timeT is [S(T)– K(t, T)].

To facilitate understanding, it is convenient to introduce another equivalent probability that facilitates computation. This equivalent probability measure makes asset payoffs at some future dateT martingales when discounted by theT – maturity zero-coupon bond price. The forward price martingale measure was first discovered by Jarrow (1987) and later, independently, by Geman (1989). Fix T 2 [0, t]; the forward price measureQ T is defined by13 dQT dQ ¼ 1 pð0; TÞBðTÞ : ð20Þ Using this measure, for any suitably measurable and integrable random payoffXT received at timeT, Xt pðt;TÞ is aQT martingale; specifically, Xt ¼ pðt; TÞET t XTðÞ ; ð21Þ where ET t /C1ðÞ is a conditional expectation under QT.

Expression 21 gives a useful alternative procedure for computing present values: Take the expectation under the probabilityQT and discount the expectation using the appropri- ate zero-coupon bond’s price. The spot rate of interest process does not explicitly appear in this expression. It is implicit, however, in the new probabilityQT.

Applying this result to the timeT price of the asset yields an equivalent expression for the forward price,14 Kðt; TÞ¼ ET t SðTÞðÞ ; ð22Þ which explains the name for this probability measure. From expression 22, we see that the forward price is not an unbiased expectation of the future price of the asset under the statistical probabilityP unless Q T = P. The difference between these two probability measures is cha", "ation of the future price of the asset under the statistical probabilityP unless Q T = P. The difference between these two probability measures is characterized by the interest rate risk premia {f1(t),... , fn (t)} and the T – maturity zero-coupon bond’s volatilities {a1(t, T),... , an (t, T)}, as given by15 dQT dP ¼ e /C0 1 2 Pn i¼1 RT 0 aiðs;TÞ2dsþ Rt 0 fiðsÞ2ds hi /C15 eþ Pn i¼1 RT 0 aiðs;TÞþfiðsÞðÞ dWiðtÞ/C0 Pn i¼1 RT 0 aiðs;TÞfiðtÞdt: ð23Þ Given nonnegative interest rate risk premia,QT = P if and only if both the interest rate risk premia and the bond’s volatilities are identically zero (deterministic interest rates).

Futures Contracts A futures contract is similar to a forward contract. It is a financial contract, written on the asset S(t), with a fixed maturityT. It represents the purchase of the asset at timeT via a prearranged payment procedure. The prearranged payment procedure is known as mark- ing to market. Marking to market obligates the purchaser (long position) to accept a continuous cash flow stream equal to the continuous changes in the futures prices f", "king to market obligates the purchaser (long position) to accept a continuous cash flow stream equal to the continuous changes in the futures prices for this contract. The time t futures prices, denoted k(t, T), are set (by market convention) such that newly issued futures contracts (at timet) on the same asset with the same maturity dateT have zero market value. Hence, futures contracts (by construction) have zero market value at all times and a continuous cash flow stream equal todk(t, T). At maturity, the last futures price must equal the asset’s price:k(T, T)= s(T). 14SðtÞ¼ pðt; TÞET t ½SðTÞ/C138 .

It can be shown (see the appendix) that the arbitrage-free futures price must be kðt; TÞ¼ ~Et½SðTÞ/C138 : ð25Þ This expression shows that the futures price is not the expected asset’s timeT price, unless Q = P. Recall that the two probability measures are equal if and only if the interest rate risk premia are identically zero. The relation between forward and futures prices follows directly from these expres- sions: Kðt; TÞ¼ kðt; TÞþ c~ovt SðTÞ; 1 BðTÞ /C18/C19 BðtÞ pðt; TÞ ; ð26Þ where ~covt /C1 ; /C1ðÞ is the cond", "rices follows directly from these expres- sions: Kðt; TÞ¼ kðt; TÞþ c~ovt SðTÞ; 1 BðTÞ /C18/C19 BðtÞ pðt; TÞ ; ð26Þ where ~covt /C1 ; /C1ðÞ is the conditional covariance under the martingale probability measureQ.

Expression 26 shows that forward and futures prices are equal if and only if, under the martingale measure, the covariance between the asset’s spot price and the money market’s value is zero. A sufficient condition for equivalence of forward and futures prices is that interest rates are deterministic (the classical result). 6. THE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS The classical (macro) e", "of forward and futures prices is that interest rates are deterministic (the classical result). 6. THE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS The classical (macro) economics literature of the term structure of interest rates charac- terizes the possible interest rate risk premia (equilibrium term structures) according to three hypotheses about investor behavior: the market segmentation hypothesis, the liquid- ity preference hypothesis, and the expectations hypothesis. The market segmentation hypothesis, normally associated with Culbertson (1957), is that the equilibrium zero-coupon bond prices of different maturities are determined in isolation of the other maturity bonds by distinct market clienteles demanding payoffs at different horizons. Hence, the relevant risk premia for each maturity bond are dete", "maturity bonds by distinct market clienteles demanding payoffs at different horizons. Hence, the relevant risk premia for each maturity bond are determined in isolation. This implies, of course, that there may be arbitrage if trading were to take place across market segments. In contrast, Hicks’s (1946) liquidity preference hypothesis is that the equilibrium zero- coupon bond prices of different maturities are jointly determined by liquidity needs across time. Also, the interest rate risk premia reflect these considerations [see also Modigliani & Sutch’s (1966) preferred habitat theory]. Modern equilibrium models of the term structure of interests rates can be viewed as the representation of the liquidity preference (or preferred habitat) hypothesis in a continuous time framework (see Cox", "erests rates can be viewed as the representation of the liquidity preference (or preferred habitat) hypothesis in a continuous time framework (see Cox et al. 1985, Dunn & Singleton 1986, and Sundaresan 1984). The expectations hypothesis (Fisher 1930 and Lutz 1940/1941) has as its basic premise that zero-coupon bonds of different maturities are perfect substitutes. In the literature, this 84 Jarrow Annu. Rev. Fin. Econ. 2009.1:69-96. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org by Cornell University on 10/06/11.

Each of these hypotheses can be character", "thesis, the return-to-maturity expectations (RME) hypothesis, and the unbiased expectations (UE) hypothesis. Each of these hypotheses can be character- ized by a formula for the zero-coupon bond’s price. This critique of the expectations hypothesis in the context of arbitrage-free pricing models was independently formulated by Jarrow (1981) and Cox et al. (1981a). The LE hypothesis is that pðt; TÞ¼ E tðe/C0 RT t rsdsÞ; ð27Þ where Et(/C1 ) denotes expectation under the statistical probability measureP. This hypothe- sis is that the price of aT – maturity zero-coupon bond is its discounted payoff using the spot rate of interest with no adjustment for risk. Equivalently, this can be written as Et dpðt; TÞ pðt; TÞ /C18/C19 ¼ rtdt: Using expression 6, this implies thatQ = P, or that the interes", "nt for risk. Equivalently, this can be written as Et dpðt; TÞ pðt; TÞ /C18/C19 ¼ rtdt: Using expression 6, this implies thatQ = P, or that the interest rate risk premia {f1(t),... , fn (t)} are identically zero. The RME hypothesis is that 1 pðt; TÞ ¼ Et BðTÞ BðtÞ /C18/C19 ¼ Et e RT t rsds /C18/C19 : ð28Þ This hypothesis is that the (T – t) – period holding period return from a zero-coupon bond is equivalent to the expected return from holding the money market account. Note that the LE and RME hypotheses are mutually exclusive (unless interest rates are deterministic) because 16 pðt; TÞLE ¼ Et e/C0 RT t rsds /C18/C19 > 1 Et e RT t rsds /C18/C19 ¼ pðt; TÞRME: The RE hypothesis could be satisfied if the interest rate risk premia are nonnegative and they (just happen to) make the zero-coupon b", "9 ¼ pðt; TÞRME: The RE hypothesis could be satisfied if the interest rate risk premia are nonnegative and they (just happen to) make the zero-coupon bond prices equal to expression 28.

These financial instruments are usually based on LIBOR, an index of Eurodollar borrowing rates. Caps are a portfolio of European caplets, with the same strike but with different and increasing maturity dates. The maturity dates of the included caplets are evenly spaced at fixed intervals (e.g., every 3 months) up to some final date, the maturity of the cap (e.g., 5 years). A European caplet (in the context of a continuous time setting) is a European call option with maturityT and strikek on the forward interest rate at time T; in other words, the timeT payoff is max[f (T, T)– k, 0]. Floors are a portfolio of floorlets with the same strike and with increasing maturity dates.", "in other words, the timeT payoff is max[f (T, T)– k, 0]. Floors are a portfolio of floorlets with the same strike and with increasing maturity dates. The se- quence of maturity dates is similar to that of a cap. A floorlet is a European put option on the forward interest rate. Using put-call parity, if one prices European caplets then the formula for European floorlets immediately follows. For this reason, this section concen- trates only on pricing caplets. Historically, given the industry’s familiarity with the BSM formula for pricing equity options, the first industry model used to price caplets was Black’s equation (Black 1976). Black’s formula requires forward rates to evolve as geometric Brownian motion (see expression 9), but unfortunately, Heath et al.

(1992) showed that this is impossible in an arbitrage-free setting. Hence, a direct application of Black’s formula to price caplets (and caps) on instantaneous and continuously compounded forward rates was shown to be inappropriate. Nonetheless, motivated by the industry’s strong desire to use Black’s formula, Sandmann et al. (1995), Miltersen et al. (1997), and Brace et al. (1997) found a more subtle argument to justify its usage. The solution was to use a simple interest rate, compounded discretely, instead of a continuously compounded instantaneous rate.

This section describes this interest rate model, known as the LIBOR model, for pricing caps and floors. For books on the LIBOR model see Musiela & Rutkowski (2004), Rebonato (2002), and Schoenmakers (2005). In our context, the LIBOR rate corresponds to the default-free interest rate that one can earn from investing dollars for a fixed time period, sayd units of a year (e.g., one-quarter of a year), quoted as a simple interest rate and not as the continuously compounded and instantaneous spot rater t.19 Just as with the continuously compounded and instantaneous forward rates, there is an analogous forward LIBOR rate.

Given the evolution for a 1 – factor forward rate process as in expression 15 and the definition (Equation 31) of the forward LIBOR rate involving zero-coupon bond prices, Ito’s lemma enables one to compute the evolution of the LIBOR forward rate as (see Shreve 2004, p. 443) dLðt; TÞ¼ 1 þ dLðt; TÞ d /C18/C19 ½aðt; T þ dÞ/C0 aðt; TÞ/C138 dWTþdðtÞ; ð32Þ where WT þ d (t) is a standard independent Brownian motion underQT þ d (see expres- sion 38 in the appendix).

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE The empirical evidence with respect to interest rate term structure models can be decom- posed into three related topics: (a) estimating the initial forward rate curve, (b) fitting the term structure evolutions, and (c) pricing various interest rate derivatives. The first two topics correspond to the inputs (see expression 2) and the third corresponds to the outputs (e.g., caps and floors) of the HJM model. 8.1. Forward Rate Curve Estimation The first input to the HJM model is the initial forward rate curve {f (0, T)f o r0/C20 t /C20 T /C20 t}.

Unfortunately, this is not directly observable. Instead, one observes either (for government debt markets) the prices of a collection of government bonds, with (long maturity) and without coupons (short maturity) or (for Eurodollar markets) Eurodollar deposit rates up to one year and swaps rates thereafter. A swap rate is analogous to a coupon-bearing bond. Conceptually, estimating the forward rate curve is a two-step procedure. Step one computes the zero-coupon bonds underlying the observed bond prices, resulting in a discrete number of zero-coupon bond price observations across maturities. Step two con- nects this set of discrete zero-coupon bond prices to obtain a continuous curve,", "zero-coupon bond price observations across maturities. Step two con- nects this set of discrete zero-coupon bond prices to obtain a continuous curve, from which forward rates can be computed. Of course, these two steps can be combined, and the resulting estimation is termed smoothing the forward rate curve. This is a well-studied topic in the interest rate term structure literature. Typical approaches use exponential or polynomial splines; references include Shea (1985), Nelson & Siegel (1987), Adams & van Deventer (1994), and Jarrow et al. (2004). Forward rate curve smoothing raises an interesting issue. If one uses, for example, a polynomial spline to fit forward rates at times 0, 1, 2, and so forth, then to have a consistent HJM evolution, it should be the case that the forward rate cu", "al spline to fit forward rates at times 0, 1, 2, and so forth, then to have a consistent HJM evolution, it should be the case that the forward rate curve evolution (Equation 2) includes in its realizations polynomial splines. Otherwise, the forward rate curve evolution is inconsistent with the smoothing procedure. This topic was studied and solved by Bjork & Christensen (1999) and Filipovic´ (2001), who provided necessary and sufficient conditions for a consistent HJM model. As might be expected, it can be shown that not all smoothing procedures are consistent with a given forward rate curve evolu- tion; for example, the Nelson-Siegel family of forward rate curves is inconsistent with forward rate evolutions having deterministic volatilities (see Nelson & Siegel 1987 and Filipovic´ 1999).", "of forward rate curves is inconsistent with forward rate evolutions having deterministic volatilities (see Nelson & Siegel 1987 and Filipovic´ 1999). 8.2.

A review paper of the empirical literature is Dai & Singleton (2003). 8.3 Pricing Interest Rate Derivatives There is also a large literature studying the pricing and hedging of interest rate derivatives.

(2001), Jarrow et al. (2007), and Gupta & Subrahmanyam (2005). A summary of the empirical evidence is contained in Rebo", "hao (2006), Long- staff et al. (2001), Jarrow et al. (2007), and Gupta & Subrahmanyam (2005). A summary of the empirical evidence is contained in Rebonato (2002). 9. APPLICATIONS TO OTHER MARKETS The HJM model is the building block for pricing and hedging all fixed-income securities, including those with credit risk. One important application has been to the risk manage- ment of mortgages, both residential and commercial. For U.S. residential mortgages guar- anteed by U.S. government agencies, the default-free model applies directly. The only remaining consideration is prepayment risk (see Stanton 1995). For nongovernment guar- anteed residential mortgages and commercial mortgages, default and prepayment are both important. Default requires the modeling of credit risk. Default-free interes", "tial mortgages and commercial mortgages, default and prepayment are both important. Default requires the modeling of credit risk. Default-free interest rate term structure models are the basis for current credit risk modeling. For textbooks on the topic see Bielecki & Rutkowski (2002) and Lando (2004). The HJM model has also been extended to include foreign currencies (see Amin & Jarrow 1991), the pricing of equities and (noninterest rate) commodities (see Amin & Jarrow 1992), to Treasury inflation protected bonds (see Jarrow & Yildirim 2003), to term structures of futures prices (see Carr & Jarrow 1995, Miltersen et al. 2006), to term structures of convenience yields (Nakajima & Maeda 2007), and to term structures of equity forward volatilities (Dupire 1992, 1996; Schweizer & Wissel 2008)", "ures of convenience yields (Nakajima & Maeda 2007), and to term structures of equity forward volatilities (Dupire 1992, 1996; Schweizer & Wissel 2008). In fact, it can be shown that almost all option pricing applications can be viewed as special cases of a multiple term structure HJM model (see Jarrow & Turnbull 1998). A summary of many of these applications can be found in Carmona (2007). 10. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS As evidenced in the text, the arbitrage-free pricing and hedging theory for the term structure of interest rates is in a mature state: Very general and abstract formulations of term structure of interest rate models are available. Yet, open questions still remain with respect to the empirical implementation of these abstract models. Which forward rate curve evolutions (HJM", "ble. Yet, open questions still remain with respect to the empirical implementation of these abstract models. Which forward rate curve evolutions (HJM volatility specifications) fit markets best? The literature, for analytic convenience, has favored the affine class but with disappointing results. More general evolutions, but with more complex computational demands, need to be studied. How many factors are needed in the term structure evolution? One or two factors are commonly used, but the evidence suggests three or four are needed to accurately price exotic interest rate derivatives. And are interest rate markets complete?

The answer to this question is intricately related to the form and the evolution estimated (the volatility structure), includ- ing the number of fit factors. The current evidence is based on too simplistic of models for the evolution of the term structure. As argued, although partial answers to all of these questions are available, they are not definitive. More research is needed to settle these issues. Settling these issues is essential for understanding risk management for both corporate and financial institutions. The capital structure decisio", "ues. Settling these issues is essential for understanding risk management for both corporate and financial institutions. The capital structure decision for a corporation, that is, the determination of the debt equity ratio, or the determination of economic capital for a financial institution (related to the Basel II Accord), depends crucially on the evolution of the term structure of interest rates. In this determination there are four risks to be consid- ered: market, credit, liquidity, and operational risk. Interest rate risk is the major compo- nent of market risk. However, these term structure models still need to be extended to include credit, liquidity, and operational risk. Although the abstract model formulation for the credit risk extension is also well understood, its empirical i", "redit, liquidity, and operational risk. Although the abstract model formulation for the credit risk extension is also well understood, its empirical implementation is not. This is especially true with respect to the inclusion of default correlations, that is, systemic risk. In contrast, the liquidity and operational risk extensions are still not yet adequately modeled. Although there has been some research in this direction, the models are complex and not easily estimated. Without the inclusion of these additional risks into a term structure of interest rate model, the proper determination of a firm’s equity capital is impossible. There is still much to understand and to learn in this regard. 11. APPENDIX 11.1. Derivation of Expression 6 First, pðt; TÞ¼ e/C0 RT t fðt;uÞdu.

Jarrow3, and Donald R. van Deventer4 Abstract This paper proposes and estimates a tractable, arbitrage-free valuation model for corporate coupon bonds that includes a more realistic recovery rate process. Most existing studies use a recovery rate process that is misspecified because it includes recovery for coupons due after default. Misspecification errors from assuming recovery on all coupons can be substantial; they increase with recovery rates, coupons, maturity, and default probabilities. For a large sample of market transactions: (i) our model has lower pricing errors than one assuming recovery on all coupons, and (ii) the magnitude of our model’s outperformance is linked to misspecification errors from assuming recov", "an one assuming recovery on all coupons, and (ii) the magnitude of our model’s outperformance is linked to misspecification errors from assuming recovery on coupons. 1Helpful comments from the editor (Hendrik Bessembinder), two anonymous referees, John Y.

A careful reading of these papers shows that they all explicitly or implicitly assume that a single credit spread or spread term structure can be used to value risky debt. The underlying assumption is that a coupon bond is equivalent to a portfolio of ri", "it spread or spread term structure can be used to value risky debt. The underlying assumption is that a coupon bond is equivalent to a portfolio of risky zero- coupon bonds that can be valued using a single spread or spread term structure. The number of zero-coupon bonds in the portfolio corresponds to the promised coupons and principal with their maturities equal to the payment dates (see expression (3) in the text). Importantly, both promised coupons and principal are discounted using the same spread. For the credit spread estimation literature, this implicit assumption follows because all promised coupons and principal are included when computing a bond’s credit spread. In the reduced form model literature, the recovery rate process utilized is the “recovery of market value (RMV)” due t", "mputing a bond’s credit spread. In the reduced form model literature, the recovery rate process utilized is the “recovery of market value (RMV)” due to Lando (1998) and Duffie and Singleton (1999), which implies this result. This pricing approach assumes that, when discounting, coupon and principal cash flows are treated the same, and, therefore, that both promised payments entitle the holder to a recovery in default. For subsequent discussion, we call this the “full-coupon recovery” model. As shown by Jarrow (2004), a single term structure of risky zero-coupon bonds used for valuing coupon bonds is valid if and only if all of the risky zero-coupon bonds are of equal seniorityandallhavethesamerecoveryrateintheeventofdefault. However, thisassumption is inconsistent with industry practice. A", "coupon bonds are of equal seniorityandallhavethesamerecoveryrateintheeventofdefault. However, thisassumption is inconsistent with industry practice. After default, as evidenced by financial restructurings and default proceedings, only the bond’s principal becomes due, and no additional coupon payments are made on or after the default date. This implies that coupon and principal payments cannot be valued using the same (single) credit spread or spread term structure and that basing a bond valuation model on this erroneous assumption of equal seniority will generate model prices with misspecification errors. Industry practice has been confirmed in the recovery rate estimation literature which 2 finds that alternative recovery rate processes,2 either the “recovery of face value (RFV)” or the", "in the recovery rate estimation literature which 2 finds that alternative recovery rate processes,2 either the “recovery of face value (RFV)” or the “recovery of Treasuries (RTV)” formulations, provide a better approximation to realized recoveryratesthan doesRMV(GuhaandSbuelz(2005), Guo, Jarrowand Lin (2008), Bakshi, Gao, and Zhong (2022)).3 And, it is well known that both the RFV and RTV recovery rate processes are consistent with a zero recovery on coupons promised after default. Therefore, these recovery rate processes do not imply the full-coupon recovery model. See Jarrow and Turnbull (2000), Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis (2005), Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002), chapter 13, Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001), and Huang and Huang (2012) for models with zero recovery on coupons promised", "and Rutkowski (2002), chapter 13, Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001), and Huang and Huang (2012) for models with zero recovery on coupons promised after default.4 The purpose of this paper is to explore, both theoretically and empirically, the effect on bond prices of assuming zero recovery on coupons after default. We refer to such a “no-coupon recovery” model to differentiate it from the “full-coupon recovery” model. We derive an intuitive and straightforward-to-implement no-coupon recovery pricing model that depends only on the risk-free term structure, risk neutral default probabilities,5 recovery rate, and an illiquidity parameter. We also present a clear and easy-to-calculate measure, the misspecification error, that identifies the effect of using a misspecified full-coupon recove", "also present a clear and easy-to-calculate measure, the misspecification error, that identifies the effect of using a misspecified full-coupon recovery rate assumption to price bonds.

Bakshi, Madan and Zhang (2006) use the Lehman Bond price data set to compare different recovery assump- tions for a sample of 25 BBB-rated bonds over a nine-year period. They find that pricing errors decline when choosing the RTV or RFV rather than RMV specification. Our paper uses a much larger data set, explores the drivers of model misspecification errors on pricing both theoretically and empirically, and estimates the effect of illiquidity on prices. We also provide direct evidence of prices reflecting no recovery on coupons by looking at prices of bonds immediately after default. 5The use of risk neutral default probabilities is essential because we are creating valuation formulas, which r", "es of bonds immediately after default. 5The use of risk neutral default probabilities is essential because we are creating valuation formulas, which require a risk premium. Later, under an additional assumption that default risk is diversifiable, risk neutral and actual probabilities are empirically equivalent. 3 fault probabilities, maturity, or coupon payments are larger. For example, given a 10-year bond with a face value of $100, a recovery rate of 50%, a coupon of 2.51%, and an annual default probability of 1%, the full-coupon recovery model will assign a price that is $0.50 too large. If it is a 30-year bond, the price error is $4.33, a substantial difference relative to the correct price, which is equal to par in both cases. We calculate exact misspecification errors and also provid", "substantial difference relative to the correct price, which is equal to par in both cases. We calculate exact misspecification errors and also provide an approximate formula that can be used to estimate the misspecifi- cation error’s magnitudes. In this approximation, misspecification errors are proportional to the recovery rate, the coupon size, the default probability, and the square of the number of coupon payments - which is closely related to maturity. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the empirical implications of the different pricing models for a large data set of coupon bond transaction prices. Before this analysis, we present direct evidence of the different payment seniority between principal and coupons.

We provide three examples of issuers that have filed for bankruptcy: Lehman Brothers, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), and Weatherford International. We use both the full-coupon recovery and no-coupon recovery models to price the bonds. We find that pricing errors from using the misspecified full-coupon recovery model are between five to ten times larger than the no-coupon recovery model’s pricing errors. This evidence is consistent with market prices reflecting zero recovery on coupons promised after default.

This sample contains close to 168 thousand bond price observations. We separately fit both models. If market prices reflect zero recovery for coupons promised after default, the no-coupon recovery model will outperform the full-coupon recovery model. To test this hypothesis, we compute the average outperformance. However, this comparison is less informative if done in isolation. The reason is that our model predicts that the outperformance’s magnitude is directly related to the size 4 of the misspecification error – the pricing error from assuming recovery for coupons promised after default", "agnitude is directly related to the size 4 of the misspecification error – the pricing error from assuming recovery for coupons promised after default. And, a small average outperformance may simply result from a sample in which these misspecification errors are small. Instead, amorerelevanttestiswhetherthemisspecificationerrorcanexplainthe variation in the magnitude of the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance. If a bond has short maturity with only a few coupons and a small default probability, the two models will predict nearly the same price (the misspecification error is close to zero) and the no-coupon recovery model will outperform only slightly. But, if the maturity is long and the default probability is substantial (and zero recovery of coupons promised after default is reflec", "only slightly. But, if the maturity is long and the default probability is substantial (and zero recovery of coupons promised after default is reflected in the data) the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance will be large. Given these insights, our empirical investigation proceeds in two steps. First, we calcu- late the misspecification errors from assuming recovery for coupon payments after default. Second, we study the performance of both the no-coupon and full-coupon recovery models separately, and analyze whether any outperformance of the no-coupon recovery model de- pends on the misspecification errors. In this empirical investigation, we fit both models to data obtaining prices, and then compare pricing errors between the two models. The evidence from the first step shows that t", "on, we fit both models to data obtaining prices, and then compare pricing errors between the two models. The evidence from the first step shows that the misspecification errors are often quite large (in our data, the 95th percentiles are between $0.97 and $2.18 per $100 face value). However, the median misspecification error is small and between 5 - 13 cents. Thus, although the no-coupon recovery model outperforms the full-coupon recovery model, for some bonds the difference is highly relevant, while for other bonds it is not. The second step amounts to a horse race between the models, but one that not only tests average outperformance but also tests whether our model’s predictions regarding relative outperformance is consistent with the data. We find evidence of the no-coupon recovery mod", "so tests whether our model’s predictions regarding relative outperformance is consistent with the data. We find evidence of the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance in the full sample. More importantly, we show that the no-coupon model’soutperformanceislargerwhenthedefaultprobability, therecoveryrate, thematurity, 5 and the coupons are larger. Thus our approach accurately forecasts when zero recovery of coupons promised after default is important for pricing. We find that the no-coupon recovery model outperformance is robust to different model implementationchoices. Weestimatetwoversionsofthetwomodels.

This model has the benefit of being stable and not requiring any additional data apart from bond prices, characteristics, and Treasury rates. In Model 2 we also implicitly estimate the recovery rate. We fit the model at the issuer-day level, and price a collection of bonds using both models. This allows the full-coupon recovery model to adjust its parameters. Therefore, what matters when comparing model fit is not the average level of the misspecification error. Indeed, if it were the same, biased inputs could result in a low pricing error.

Instead, the within issuer- day misspecification error’s standard deviation is what is relevant. When it is large, the misspecified model will have difficulty adjusting and is more likely to underperform. We find exactly this pattern in the data. For example, when focusing attention on the top quartile of misspecification error standard deviation observations, the pricing error difference increases from 7.2 to 22.4 cents (model 1). One implication of our results is that default probability and recovery rate have distinct effects on the bond’s price. As a result, it is possible to back out implied recovery rates from observed bond prices, something that is not possible in the full -coupon recovery model.6 In terms of spreads, recovery rate and default probability have different impac", "s, something that is not possible in the full -coupon recovery model.6 In terms of spreads, recovery rate and default probability have different impacts on principal and coupon-specific spreads (coupon spreads are unaffected by changes in the recovery rate because they have zero recovery). We exploit this pattern in model 3, where we use an external estimate of the default probability and fit a parameter for illiquidity. The outline of the paper is as follows.

Section 7 concludes. II. The Pricing Model This section presents the pricing model, which is based on the reduced form model of Jarrow and Turnbull (1995). We assume that traded in the economy are default-free zero- coupon bonds of all maturities, a default-free money market account, and a risky coupon bond (to be desc", "traded in the economy are default-free zero- coupon bonds of all maturities, a default-free money market account, and a risky coupon bond (to be described later). The market is assumed to be frictionless and competitive. Both the frictionless and competitive market assumptions are relaxed, subsequently, when we add an illiquidity discount to the valuation formula (see expression (4) below). The default-free money market account earns interest continuously at the default-free spot rate of interest,rt. The money market account’s timet value is denoted by (1) Bt = e R t 0 rsds with B0 = 1. We let the timet value of a default-free zero-coupon bond paying a dollar at time T be strictly positive and denoted byp(t, T) > 0. We consider a firm that issues a bond with a coupon ofC dollars, a face v", "nd paying a dollar at time T be strictly positive and denoted byp(t, T) > 0. We consider a firm that issues a bond with a coupon ofC dollars, a face value equal to L dollars, and a maturity dateT. The bond pays theC dollar coupons at intermediate dates {t1, ..., tm = T}, but only up to the default timeτ. For notational convenience, let the current timet = t0. If default happens in the time interval(tk−1, tk], then the bond pays a 7 stochastic recovery rate ofδtk ∈ [0, 1] at timetk on the notional ofL dollars.7 It is important to note that default can happen anytime within this interval, but the payment only occurs at the end. If default does not happen, the face value ofL dollars is repaid at timeT. A. Risk Neutral Valuation To value the risky coupon bond, we assume (i) that the markets fo", "not happen, the face value ofL dollars is repaid at timeT. A. Risk Neutral Valuation To value the risky coupon bond, we assume (i) that the markets for both the default- free coupon bonds and the risky coupon bond are arbitrage-free and (ii) that enough credit derivatives trade on the risky firm so that the enlarged market is complete (see Jacod and Protter (2010) for a set of sufficient conditions on an incomplete market such that the ex- panded market is complete). Given the trading of credit default swaps, this is a reasonable approximation. With only a minor loss of generality, we introduce a novelconditional independenceas- sumption to facilitate analytic tractability. The conditional independence assumption (see the online appendix for the formal definition) is that the default-free", "acilitate analytic tractability. The conditional independence assumption (see the online appendix for the formal definition) is that the default-free spot ratert, the default time τ, and the recovery rate processδt are independent under the risk neutral probabil- ity Q given the information at timet. This is a weak assumption on the evolutions of the default-free spot rate, the default time, and the recovery rate because it imposes very little structure on their evolutions under the statistical probabilities. Under the statistical proba- bilities, these processes need not be independent. Hence, nonzero pairwise correlations under the statistical probabilities between the observed default-free spot rate, the default time, and the recovery rate processes, are not excluded by this assumption.", "cal probabilities between the observed default-free spot rate, the default time, and the recovery rate processes, are not excluded by this assumption. And, it is well known that non-zero correlations across the default-free spot rate, default times, and recovery rates have been observed in historical data. 7In practice, a portion of the next coupon payment after default represents some accrued interest earned, but not yet paid. This accrued interest has a recovery rate associated with it. With a slight loss of generality we exclude this accrued interest payment in the stochastic recovery rateδtk defined above. We appreciate the comments from a law firm, Morrison & Foerster, in this regard. 8 Denote the timet ≤ t1 value of the coupon bond asvt. Under the conditional indepen- dence assumptio", "a law firm, Morrison & Foerster, in this regard. 8 Denote the timet ≤ t1 value of the coupon bond asvt. Under the conditional indepen- dence assumption, we show in the online appendix that the coupon bond’s price is (2) vt = Xm k=1 C × z(t, tk) + L × z(t, T) + L × dt Xm k=1 x(t, tk) where dt := EQ [δτ |Ft ] z(t, tk) := p(t, tk)[1 − Q(t, tk)] x(t, tk) := p(t, tk)[Q(t, tk+1) − Q(t, tk)] Q(t, ti) := P robQ [τ ≤ ti |Ft ] . In this expression: (i) Q(t, ti) is the timet conditional risk neutral probability of default beforeti given no default at timet, (ii) dt is the timet futures recovery rate (for a futures contract receiving the recovery rate at timeT∗, see the online appendix for the details). As a futures price, the recovery rate in our valuation formula is aQ - martingale. This is an impor", "timeT∗, see the online appendix for the details). As a futures price, the recovery rate in our valuation formula is aQ - martingale. This is an important implication of the conditional independence assumption underlying expression (2). Because it is a futures price, it is expected to be slightly larger than the recovery rate if paid on the debt at timet, δt (see the online appendix for a proof). (iii) z(t, tk) is asurvival digital, which pays $1 at timetk only if default occurs aftertk, 0 otherwise. (iv) x(t, tk) is adefault digital, which pays $1 at timetk if default occurs within(tk−1, tk], 0 otherwise. We refer to this expression as the “no-coupon recovery” model to emphasize that it has no recovery on the promised coupons after default. In this form it is easy to see that the 9 value", "no-coupon recovery” model to emphasize that it has no recovery on the promised coupons after default. In this form it is easy to see that the 9 value of this coupon bond is not equal to the sum of the coupons and principal times the value of a collection of risky zero-coupon bonds. Indeed, letD(t, tk) denote the timet value of such a risky zero-coupon bond promising to pay a dollar at timetk for k = 1, . . . , mwith recovery rateδt in default. Then, it can be shown that (3) vfull coupon t = Pm k=1 C × D(t, tk) + L × D(t, T) = Pm k=1 C × z(t, tk) + L × z(t, T) + L × dt Pm k=1 x(t, tk) + Pm k=1 C × (m + 1 − k) × x(t, tk). This expression is called the “full-coupon recovery model.” The difference between this model and expression (2) is the termPm k=1 C × (m + 1 − k) × dt × x(t, tk),8 which r", "led the “full-coupon recovery model.” The difference between this model and expression (2) is the termPm k=1 C × (m + 1 − k) × dt × x(t, tk),8 which represents the present value of the recovery on the coupons promised after default. B. An Illiquidity Discount Corporate bond markets are illiquid relative to Treasury bonds or exchange traded eq- uities. This illiquidity implies that corporate bond prices may reflect an illiquidity discount (see Jarrow and Turnbull (1997), Duffie and Singleton (1999), Cherian, Jacquier, and Jar- row (2004)). An illiquidity discount modifies the previous valuation formula to implicitly incorporate the impact on pricing due to transaction costs and trading constraints. It is important to note that transactions costs (including bid/ask spreads) are a special cas", "ricing due to transaction costs and trading constraints. It is important to note that transactions costs (including bid/ask spreads) are a special case of an illiquidity cost paid when trading, which are implicitly included via an illiquidity discount (see Cetin, Jarrow and Protter (2004) for the theoretical justification of this state- ment). Similarly, taxes paid on coupons and capital gains can also be interpreted as a type 8This term follows because if default occurs during the time interval(tk−1, tk], the remaining future coupons arePm j=k C = (m + 1− k)C. In the full coupon recovery model, one gets a recovery payment on all the remaining coupons. 10 of transaction cost, and hence they too are implicitly included in the illiquidity discount as well.9 We apply the illiquidity discount", "g coupons. 10 of transaction cost, and hence they too are implicitly included in the illiquidity discount as well.9 We apply the illiquidity discount functioneαt(T−t) symmetrically to all the cash flows promised to the coupon bond. This symmetry enables similar illiquidity discount impacts across different coupon bonds issued by the same credit entity. Given this, we can rewrite the coupon bond’s value as (4) vliq t = Xm k=1 C × z(t, tk)eαt(tk−t) + L × z(t, T)eαt(T−t) + L × dt Xm k=1 x(t, tk)eαt(tk−t).

Our estimation procedure allows for these estimated parameter values to reflect this randomness.10 Expression (4) is the valuation model estimated in the empirical analysis. III. Misspecification Errors This section builds intuition for misspecification errors when using the full-coupon recov- ery model, expression (3) instead of the no-coupon recovery model, expression (2). Recall thatthemisspecificationerror, thedifferencebetweenthefull-couponandno-couponrecovery 9The complication of explicitly including illiquidity costs (transaction, taxes) into the model is that dif- ferent traders face different taxes and transaction costs b", "of explicitly including illiquidity costs (transaction, taxes) into the model is that dif- ferent traders face different taxes and transaction costs based on their trading activities. Consequently, to determine a market price, an equilibrium model is needed. Equilibrium models are notoriously ladened with unrealistic assumptions. Furthermore, an argument can be made that the marginal trader, who deter- mines the market price, is the lowest illiquidity cost trader. Here, we note that many institutions pay small transaction costs and there do exist non-taxable institutions that purchase corporate debt. 10We use implicit estimation at a fixed timet allowing αt to depend on the information available at time t. 11 model prices, is equal toPm k=1 C ×(m+1 −k)×dt ×x(t, tk). Note that these misspec", "met allowing αt to depend on the information available at time t. 11 model prices, is equal toPm k=1 C ×(m+1 −k)×dt ×x(t, tk). Note that these misspecification errors are always positive. We next quantify the magnitudes of these misspecification errors and provide a simple approximation that allows us to relate the misspecification errors to the model’s inputs. Later, we relate the predicted misspecification errors to patterns in the data. A. Misspecification Error Determinants For illustrative purposes we make the following simplifying assumptions: (1) coupon bonds are priced on coupon dates, (2) the risk-free term structure of interest rates and the term structure of risk neutral default probabilities are flat,11 (3) the coupon is set so that the no-coupon recovery model’s bond price is", "s and the term structure of risk neutral default probabilities are flat,11 (3) the coupon is set so that the no-coupon recovery model’s bond price is equal to par, and (4) there is no illiquidity discount (αt = 0 ), though we relax this last assumption when we consider the effect of model parameters on spreads.12 Combined, these imply that the misspecification error is fully determined by the maturity, default probability, recovery rate, and risk-free rate. We note the use of risk neutral default probabilities is essential because we are creating valuation formulas, which require a risk premium. Later, under an additional assumption that default risk is diversifiable, the distinction between risk neutral and actual probabilities disappear because under this assumption they are empirically", "ult risk is diversifiable, the distinction between risk neutral and actual probabilities disappear because under this assumption they are empirically equivalent. Our data, which we describe in more detail in Section 4, consists of more than 168 thousand observations from September 2017 to August 2022 for a total of 197 issuers. More than ninety percent of the data have investment grade level ratings equal to BBB- or above;13 11In the empirical implementation (Model 3) we use a term structure of risk neutral default probabilities, which is not assumed to be flat. 12In this case, the full coupon recovery model including a liquidity discount isvfull coupon t = Pm k=1 C × z(t, tk)eαt(tk−t) +L×z(t, T)eαt(T−t) +L×dt Pm k=1 x(t, tk)eαt(tk−t)+ Pm k=1 C ×(m+1 −k)×x(t, tk)eαt(tk−t). The last term is", "full coupon t = Pm k=1 C × z(t, tk)eαt(tk−t) +L×z(t, T)eαt(T−t) +L×dt Pm k=1 x(t, tk)eαt(tk−t)+ Pm k=1 C ×(m+1 −k)×x(t, tk)eαt(tk−t). The last term is the misspecification error. 13The sample consists primarily of investment grade bonds since many high yield bonds have call features, all of which are excluded. An analysis of callable bonds goes beyond the scope of this paper. 12 averagematurityisequalto3.1years, theaveragecouponequals3.1percent. Wealsoconsider issuer-day-level statistics since we estimate the model at that level: the average issuer-day has five observations; ninety five percent of issuer days have eleven or fewer observations; the average different between the shortest and longest maturity within each issuer-day (‘maturity range’) is 3.9 years, and ninety percent of observ", "; the average different between the shortest and longest maturity within each issuer-day (‘maturity range’) is 3.9 years, and ninety percent of observations have maturity ranges between 0.9 and 8.6 years. Our sample is therefore appropriate to study how default risky coupon bonds should be priced. Table 1 reports misspecification errors across different inputs, assuming that the risk-free term structure is flat at 2%. The par value of the bond is set to 100 and the recovery rate is equal to 50%, a level close to the mean recovery rate we estimate (see below). As expected, misspecification errors increase with the bond’s maturity and the issuer’s default probability. For short maturity 2-year bonds, the misspecification error is equal to 0.07 if the annual default probability is 2%, while t", "r’s default probability. For short maturity 2-year bonds, the misspecification error is equal to 0.07 if the annual default probability is 2%, while the misspecification error is equal to 1.39 for a 10-year bond with the same default probability. For 30-year bonds the misspecification error can be much larger, reaching a level of 9.62 for a 2% default probability bond, close to 10% of that bond’s price. We now propose a simple approximation for the misspecification error. In the event of default, the present value of the payoff for the first coupon is equal to the discounted value of the product of the coupon rate, the recovery value, and the probability of default, i.e.C × dt ×p(t, t1)Q(t, t1). The approximate total error is equal toC ×dt ×p(t, t1)Q(t, t1)m(m+1)/2 (see the online appendix", "probability of default, i.e.C × dt ×p(t, t1)Q(t, t1). The approximate total error is equal toC ×dt ×p(t, t1)Q(t, t1)m(m+1)/2 (see the online appendix for additional detail). We later use the misspecification error to identify portfolios of bonds that are likely to be mispriced by the full-coupon recovery model. We note that the misspecification error is zero if the recovery rate, the default probability, or the coupon payment is zero. The error grows approximately with the square of the number of coupon payments and is exactly proportional to the product of the coupon payment and the recovery rate. Thus, bonds with 13 significant recovery values, default probabilities, and with intermediate to long maturities will have significant misspecification errors. B. Pricing with Two Credit Spread", "lues, default probabilities, and with intermediate to long maturities will have significant misspecification errors. B. Pricing with Two Credit Spread Curves If coupons have a zero recovery after default, while the principal payment has a positive recovery, both cash flows will not have the same discount rate. Using the same credit spread for both will result in an inability to price bonds with different maturities and coupons. However, a priori it is not clear if the effect we are focusing on is empirically large or small. Spreads appropriate for discounting coupons and principal may be similar.14 Before proceed- ing with our full model estimation, we examine the difference in the two pricing approaches by examining seniority-specific spreads. If there is a misspecification error using th", "mation, we examine the difference in the two pricing approaches by examining seniority-specific spreads. If there is a misspecification error using this full- coupon recovery model to price bonds, then the two curves will be different. The valuation formula using different credit spreads for coupon and principal payments is (5) vspread t = Xm k=1 C × p(t, tk)e−sC(t,tk)(tk−t) + L × p(t, T)e−sL(t,T)(T−t) where sC(t, tk) and sL(t, T) are credit spreads at timet for the coupon and principal cash flows at timestk and T, respectively, above the default-free rates implicit in the zero-coupon bond pricesp(t, tk).15 Table 2 provides some illustrative examples of credit spread curves. We use the same methodology as in Table 1. The only difference is that here we introduce the effect of an illiquidit", "examples of credit spread curves. We use the same methodology as in Table 1. The only difference is that here we introduce the effect of an illiquidity discount. Panel A reports principal spreads, Panel B reports coupon spreads. 14We note that we are interested in pricing multiple bonds simultaneously. It is, of course, possible to calculate a bond-specific yield to maturity and therefore a bond specific credit spread. This, however, does not provide a pricing methodology, but it is simply a transformation of the price into another quantity. 15This is the same as definingp(t, tk)e−sC(t,tk)(tk−t) = DS(t, tk) andp(t, T)e−sC(t,T)(T−t) = DL(t, T), which correspond to distinct risky zero-coupon bond price term structures for discounting coupons and principal cash flows. 14 As long as there is a", ", which correspond to distinct risky zero-coupon bond price term structures for discounting coupons and principal cash flows. 14 As long as there is a positive recovery, coupon spreads lie above principal spreads since the latter will be worth more and thus are discounted less. The difference between coupon and principal spreads is close to the product of the default probability and the recovery rate, which follows from the misspecification error relation given above, where, for the first coupon, the misspecification error is equal toC × dt × p(t, t1)Q(t, t1). A larger default probability makes all spreads higher. If there is no illiquidity discount, coupon spreads are approximately equal to the default probability, and since differences relative to principal spreads depend on the default", "iscount, coupon spreads are approximately equal to the default probability, and since differences relative to principal spreads depend on the default probability, frictionless spreads are approximately proportional to the default probability. The effect of the illiquidity discount is seen to be symmetric, affecting all cash flows equally. Indeed, both credit spreads increase by the amount of the illiquidity discount. The results imply that principal payments are safer because they deliver potentially large recovery values in the event of default. Coupon payments, in contrast, do not pay off in default and therefore need a larger discount rate. It is useful to note that using a single spread is not suitable to discount both cash flows with zero or positive recovery. For the former (the coup", ". It is useful to note that using a single spread is not suitable to discount both cash flows with zero or positive recovery. For the former (the coupons), the spread will be too low and for the latter (the principal) it will be too high. Thus, using a single spread (or spread curve) to price a new bond with a different maturity or coupon will result in misspecification errors. In addition, using this ‘standard’ spread calculation to assess the market’s implied risk pricing is not possible. IV. Data and Estimation The details of the estimation procedures are as follows. To fit the valuation model to market prices, we obtain traded coupon bond prices for the 1,248 trading days from the beginning of September 2017 until the end of August 2022 using the TRACE system. The pricing model is for", "prices for the 1,248 trading days from the beginning of September 2017 until the end of August 2022 using the TRACE system. The pricing model is for senior unsecured fixed-rate coupon bonds with no embedded options. For each firm, we therefore eliminate from the sample any subordinated bonds, 15 callable and putable bonds, structured bonds, bonds with “death puts” or a “survivor option,” and floating rate bonds. Survivor option bonds distort bond prices both because they are issued in small amounts (typically $20 million or less per tranche) and because the value of the embedded put option is significant. The survivor option feature has become more common in recent years.16 In addition, to be included in our sample, the bond issue’s daily trade volume had to exceed $50,000 (in almost ever", "me more common in recent years.16 In addition, to be included in our sample, the bond issue’s daily trade volume had to exceed $50,000 (in almost every case, volume was much larger) and with at least two separate bonds traded (to ensure model convergence, for issuer-days with only two observations we also require that the maturities are at least half a year apart). We further excluded some bonds of European issuers subject to a 2014 EU regulation allowing regulators to demand an exchange of senior debt securities into equity. Because data assembly and cleaning costs are substantial,17 we restrict our attention to the sample starting in 2017. Finally, we restrict attention to bond price observations with prices above risk-free bond prices with the same set of cash flows.18 The resulting sam", "Finally, we restrict attention to bond price observations with prices above risk-free bond prices with the same set of cash flows.18 The resulting sample consists of more than 168 thousand observations for 197 issuers and more than 35 thousand issuer days. Table 3 presents summary statistics. The average coupon is equal to 3.1%, average 16The largest issuers of survivor option bonds as of 2016 included General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Ford Motor, HSBC Holdings, National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Cor- poration, Dow Chemical, Prospect Capital, and Barclays PLC. A typical survivor option bond’s terms are described as follows in a recent prospectus supplement from General Electric Capital Corporation: “Specific notes may contain a provision permitting th", "escribed as follows in a recent prospectus supplement from General Electric Capital Corporation: “Specific notes may contain a provision permitting the optional repayment of those notes prior to stated maturity, if requested by the authorized representative of the beneficial owner of those notes, following the death of the beneficial owner of the notes, so long as the notes were owned by the beneficial owner or his or her estate at least six months prior to the request. This feature is referred to as a ‘Survivor’s Option.’ Your notes will not be repaid in this manner unless the pricing supplement for your notes provides for the Survivor’s Option. The right to exercise the Survivor’s Option is subject to limits set by us on (1) the permitted dollar amount of total exercises by all holders o", "ion. The right to exercise the Survivor’s Option is subject to limits set by us on (1) the permitted dollar amount of total exercises by all holders of notes in any calendar year, and (2) the permitted dollar amount of an individual exercise by a holder of a note in any calendar year.” 17It is necessary to screen out callables and survivor options, data on which is only available in the pricing supplement. The SEC and FINRA do not maintain public access to prospectus data for more than about 5 years in easily accessible form. Thus including, for example, data from the financial crisis is not feasible. In addition, the TABB group finds a very high frequency of errors “TABB Group analysis shows reconciliation differences in more than 20% of new issues.” (http://www.finregalert.com/an-sec-man", "high frequency of errors “TABB Group analysis shows reconciliation differences in more than 20% of new issues.” (http://www.finregalert.com/an-sec-mandated-corporate-bond- data-monopoly-will-not-help-quality/). There are also non–trivial computational costs. 18Some observations have prices above risk-free bond prices (i.e. negative implied credit spreads), perhaps due to data errors. A negative credit spread could signal a potential arbitrage opportunity. However, it may be difficult to capitalize on such mispricing because of illiquidity. We leave further exploration of these patterns to future research. 16 maturity is equal to 3.1 years,19 and the mean credit spread is 80 bps. There is quite a bit of variation in the data – 5th to 95th percentile ranges of coupons, maturity and spreads a", "and the mean credit spread is 80 bps. There is quite a bit of variation in the data – 5th to 95th percentile ranges of coupons, maturity and spreads are 4.2, 7.9 years, and 201 bps, respectively. This variation is important for our ability to identify differences in the no-coupon and full-coupon recovery models. Misspecification errors are small if the coupon is low and the maturity is short, while they are high if the maturity is long and the coupon is large. If there is little variation in misspecification errors, the full- coupon recovery model may produce biased estimates, but the pricing errors may be similar to the no-coupon recovery model. However, taking a look at the issuer-day level statistics we find a lot of variation. Average maturity range is almost four years and the average", "del. However, taking a look at the issuer-day level statistics we find a lot of variation. Average maturity range is almost four years and the average issuer day has five bond price observations in it. There is also variation in credit ratings. The average rating is A- and 7.6% of observations are for non-investment grade (BB+ and below) issuers. Table 3 Panel B reports additional firm characteristics across rating groups. In order to fit the bond pricing model to data, we require at least two and ideally more observations for each issuer day. This restriction naturally focuses attention on issuers with a lot of outstanding debt, in particular financial institutions that tend to issue a lot of bonds. We note that across the four rating groups average book leverage declines as rating increa", "r financial institutions that tend to issue a lot of bonds. We note that across the four rating groups average book leverage declines as rating increases (i.e. rating quality declines), no doubt because choice of leverage is endogenous and financial institutions often have low-risk ratings and high leverage. The pattern in stock return volatility is as we would expect; as rating increases, volatility increases from 24% for AA and above to 46% for non-investment grade issuers. While there is little variation in leverage within rating group, the variation in volatility is much larger and increases with rating. Credit spreads exhibit a similar pattern, ranging from 46 bps for AA and above to 210 bps for non-investment grade. To these data, we add U.S. Treasury yields reported daily by the U.S", "attern, ranging from 46 bps for AA and above to 210 bps for non-investment grade. To these data, we add U.S. Treasury yields reported daily by the U.S. Department of the Treasury20 and derive the maximum smoothness Treasury forward rate curves from these 19Model 3 (discussed below) implementation is based on default probabilities that extend to a maturity of ten years. We therefore restrict attention to observations with that maximum maturity. 20https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield 17 data (see Adams and van Deventer (1994)). Using these historical forward rate curves, we compute the term structure of default-free zero coupon bond prices on all dates. Finally, we assemble data on coupon bond prices. The price in the TRACE", "pute the term structure of default-free zero coupon bond prices on all dates. Finally, we assemble data on coupon bond prices. The price in the TRACE system does not represent the full amount paid for the bond. The full amount paid is the price plus accrued interest. In our estimation, we compare the full amount paid when acquiring the bond (the present value of the bond purchase) with the valuation model in expression (4). Specifically, each issuer day, we use the risk-free term structure, coupon payments and payment dates as inputs. We then use non-linear least squares estimation, calculated on a volume-weighted basis, to solve for the best fitting parameter values (recovery rate, default probability, illiquidity). We estimate the no-coupon and the full-coupon recovery models separately", "fitting parameter values (recovery rate, default probability, illiquidity). We estimate the no-coupon and the full-coupon recovery models separately and compare pricing errors as well as parameter estimates. A. Three Empirical Model Implementations Each issuer day we fit the data to three different empirical implementations of the model. 1. Implied Default Probabilities (Models 1 and 2) Model 1 starts with a restricted version of the model, which allows us to clearly trace the effect of estimating both the full and no-coupon recovery models on misspecification errors, pricing errors, and parameter estimates. We first fit our model, expression (4), assuming a flat term structure of default probabilities estimated implicitly. We also assume no liquidity discount,21 andafixedrecoveryratefutu", "n (4), assuming a flat term structure of default probabilities estimated implicitly. We also assume no liquidity discount,21 andafixedrecoveryratefuturesprice(recoveryrateforshort)equalto50%, which 21In the model, a change in the default probability affects the present value of all cash flows, both coupons and principal. The same is true for a change in the illiquidity parameter. From expression (4) and the spread curve examples in Table 2 we know that the effect is not exactly the same, and so it is possible 18 is close to the average recovery rate estimated in the less restrictive model implementation given below. Importantly, this model has only one parameter, the default probability. Model 1 allows us to see the direct impact of misspecification on estimated default probabilities as we", "s only one parameter, the default probability. Model 1 allows us to see the direct impact of misspecification on estimated default probabilities as well as model outperformance relative to the full-coupon recovery model. In Model 2, we relax the restriction on recovery rates and instead allow it to vary between 0.1 and 0.8. This model has two parameters and it is significantly more flexible. We restrict default probabilities to be greater than 0.1% – close to the first percentile of the distribution when using an historically estimated default probability, discussed below. These bounds on the default probability and recovery rates reduce excessive model flexibility, in particular for the full-coupon recovery model, and allow us to trace the effect of misspecification errors on pricing erro", "ssive model flexibility, in particular for the full-coupon recovery model, and allow us to trace the effect of misspecification errors on pricing errors more easily. Both models 1 and 2 have the advantage that they require only bond prices and the term structure of risk-free Treasury rates as inputs. 2. Historically Estimated Default Probabilities (Model 3) Model 3, instead of estimating default probabilities implicitly using bond price data, uses a historically estimated default probability. That is, we employ independently estimated default probabilities from a proportional hazard rate model. Because there is then one less parameter to fit, in this version of the model we include an illiquidity discount parameter together with the recovery rate. To facilitate the estimation of the defaul", "in this version of the model we include an illiquidity discount parameter together with the recovery rate. To facilitate the estimation of the default intensity process, we assume that the default time τ corresponds to the first jump time of a Cox process with intensityλt = λt(Γt) ≥ 0 where Γt = (Γ1(t), . . . ,Γm(t))′ ∈ Rm are a collection of stochastic processes characterizing the state of the firm and the market at timet. In addition, we assume that default risk is diversifiable in the sense of Jarrow, Lando, and Yu (2005).22 This assumption enables the to estimate both separately. Nevertheless, to guard against unstable estimates or overfitting, we set the illiquidity discount equal to zero and estimate only a default intensity. In Model 2, we also fit the recovery rate. When using his", "itting, we set the illiquidity discount equal to zero and estimate only a default intensity. In Model 2, we also fit the recovery rate. When using historically-estimated default probability (Model 3) we also add an illiquidity parameter (see below). 22For additional detail, see the online appendix. 19 estimation of default intensities without the need to adjust the intensity process for a default jump risk premium. In conjunction, these two assumptions imply that we can estimate the default probabilities using a proportional hazard rate model (see Fleming and Harrington (1991), p. 126), i.e. λt(Γt) = θeϕΓt where θ is a constant and whereϕ is a vector of constants. For an application of such a hazard rate model applied to corporate default probabilities see Chava and Jarrow (2004). As discu", "a vector of constants. For an application of such a hazard rate model applied to corporate default probabilities see Chava and Jarrow (2004). As discussed in Jarrow, Lando, and Yu (2005), this assumption does not imply that risky coupon bonds earn no risk premium. Quite the contrary. If the state variables Γt driving the default process represent systematic risk, which is the most likely case, then risky coupon bond prices necessarily earn a risk premium due to the bond price’s correlation to Γt. The diversifiable risk assumption just states that the timing of the default event itself, after conditioning onΓt, is diversifiable in a large portfolio. Alternatively stated, in a poor economy all firms are more likely to default. But, the timing of which firms actually default depends on the id", "folio. Alternatively stated, in a poor economy all firms are more likely to default. But, the timing of which firms actually default depends on the idiosyncratic risks of the firm’s management and operations. The default process parameters(θ, ϕ) from the proportional hazard rate model were pro- vided by the Kamakura Risk Information Services (KRIS) division of SAS Institute, Inc.23 KRIS uses a refinement of the approach employed by Chava and Jarrow (2004) to estimate these parameters that are then used to construct the full term structure of cumulative de- fault probabilities.24 Specifically, for each issuer-day we obtain cumulative default probabili- ties from the 10-year term structure of monthly marginal default probabilities (the monthly probability of default conditional on no prior d", "robabili- ties from the 10-year term structure of monthly marginal default probabilities (the monthly probability of default conditional on no prior default). The state variables used in KRIS’s hazard rate estimation include both firm specific and macroeconomic variables. Importantly, 23See www.kamakuraco.com. 24The model underlying the default probability calculations is similar to the one used in Campbell, Hilscher and Szilagyi (2008, 2011), who extend Chava and Jarrow (2004) and Shumway (2001). Campbell et al. show that the default probability measure is a more accurate predictor of failure than Moody’s EDF numbers, data that have been widely used in academic studies, e.g. Berndt, Douglas, Duffie and Ferguson (2018). 20 the default probabilities do not use traded bond or CDS prices as i", "ely used in academic studies, e.g. Berndt, Douglas, Duffie and Ferguson (2018). 20 the default probabilities do not use traded bond or CDS prices as inputs. Default probabili- ties are therefore separate inputs relative to the observed bond prices that we fit using model 3. We restrict the recovery rate to lie between 0.1 and 0.8 and the illiquidity discount to lie between zero and -5%. Doing so will reduce the influence of observed bond price errors on the estimates. We report robustness checks below. V. Illustrations: Coupon and Principal Seniority in Default Before moving to the full sample estimation, this section provides evidence that market prices reflect the difference in seniority between principal and coupons in default. We consider three companies that filed for bankruptcy: Lehm", "arket prices reflect the difference in seniority between principal and coupons in default. We consider three companies that filed for bankruptcy: Lehman, PG&E, and Weatherford International. Lehman is chosen because of the size and importance of its bankruptcy. The latter two firms are in our sample because each firm has a sufficient number of bonds traded. In each case we focus on senior bonds, including callable bonds, because on the day bankruptcy is announced the call option is worthless and can be ignored. We fit the no-coupon and full-coupon recovery models to the data. The key reason for analyzing issuer bonds after they file for bankruptcy is that the default probability equals 100%.25 The recovery amount for the no-coupon recovery model is the recovery rate times the notional of $", "uptcy is that the default probability equals 100%.25 The recovery amount for the no-coupon recovery model is the recovery rate times the notional of $100 (par value) for each of the bonds. In contrast, the recovery amount for the full-coupon recovery model is $100 plus the dollar coupon times the number of remaining payments on each bond, a different amount for each issue. For each 25Since the bonds are in default, we can include both non-callable as well as callable bonds in this analysis. 21 issuer day and for both of the models, referring back to expression (4), (6) vt = dt × L, because: (i) default has occurred and there are no more coupon payments after timet, (ii) the principal is immediately due, and (iii) the liquidity discount is assumed to be zero because the bond has defaulted.", "n payments after timet, (ii) the principal is immediately due, and (iii) the liquidity discount is assumed to be zero because the bond has defaulted. We run a regression on this formula to derive the recovery rate and the present values (price plus accrued interest) for each bond. As noted earlier, expression (4) ignores the interest earned since the last coupon payment date. This would be included in the market prices. Figures1-3depictthepricingerrors. Weorderthebondsbymaturity. Pricingerrorswhen usingtheno-couponrecoverymodel(inblue)aresubstantiallylowerthanthoseresultingfrom the full-coupon recovery model (in red). Mean absolute errors are more than five times as large for Lehman (2.0 vs. 11.0) and almost ten times as large for PG&E (2.1 vs. 19.7) and Weatherford International (2.6 vs.", "more than five times as large for Lehman (2.0 vs. 11.0) and almost ten times as large for PG&E (2.1 vs. 19.7) and Weatherford International (2.6 vs. 21.0). We see that the full-coupon recovery model results in prices that are too large, especially for bonds of longer maturities that have more coupons, which if they were of equal seniority, would entitle the bondholder to a recovery value. However, in default those coupons are worthless and so any coupon paying bond would have pricing errors that are positive as long as the model was using unbiased inputs. However, in an attempt to fit the data, the model tries to reduce the average pricing error resulting in bonds with short maturities being underpriced and bonds with long maturities being overpriced. The maximum errors lie between 19.6 a", "rror resulting in bonds with short maturities being underpriced and bonds with long maturities being overpriced. The maximum errors lie between 19.6 and 37.4. It is worth noting that average market prices are equal to 32.4 (Lehman), 78.2 (PG&E), and 65.0 (Weatherford International) so that the maximum errors are around one half the market price. The (negative) minimum errors are similar in size lying between -37.2 and -14.2. In contrast, the no-coupon recovery model’s maximum and minimum pricing errors are 22 much smaller. They lie between 3.9 and 9.1 and -5 and -2.7, and so are approximately one quarter of the full-coupon recovery model pricing errors. Importantly, and in direct support of the no-coupon recovery model, its pricing errors have no clear pattern relative to the bond’s maturi", "ing errors. Importantly, and in direct support of the no-coupon recovery model, its pricing errors have no clear pattern relative to the bond’s maturity. To summarize, Lehman, PG&E and Weatherford International’s bond prices provide di- rect evidence in support of the no-coupon relative to the full-coupon recovery model. Failing to take into account the different seniority of coupons and principal results in substantial pricing errors, which have a predictable pattern consistent with our model. VI. The Pricing Model Comparison This section provides a comparative analysis of the no-coupon and full-coupon recovery models.26 The full-coupon recovery model produces different prices only if misspecification errors (see section 3) are non-zero. We therefore investigateboth if the no-coupon recov", "very model produces different prices only if misspecification errors (see section 3) are non-zero. We therefore investigateboth if the no-coupon recovery model has better fit on average, and also if it has better fit when misspecification errors are larger. Both of these predictions are implications of our model because if bonds are priced according to the no-coupon recovery model, then a necessary condition for model outperformance is the presence of misspecification errors. A. Misspecification Errors 26In a previous version of the paper we also compared the no-coupon recovery model to one based on ratings. In that model coupons are assumed to have full recovery and the credit spread is assumed to depend only on the rating. The ratings-based valuation model is consistent with numerous pro", "to have full recovery and the credit spread is assumed to depend only on the rating. The ratings-based valuation model is consistent with numerous pronouncements from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2010, 2017). It performs poorly primarily because of the erroneous assumption that all firms that have the same rating have the same risk; analyzing it is therefore less relevant when comparing no-coupon and full-coupon recovery models. 23 Before analyzing model fit and outperformance, we first consider the distribution of the misspecification errors. We use the unbiased estimates from the no-coupon recovery model as inputstocomputethemisspecificationerrorasthedifferenceinpricesbetweenthefull-coupon and the no-coupon recovery model. Recall that the misspecification error is approxim", "misspecificationerrorasthedifferenceinpricesbetweenthefull-coupon and the no-coupon recovery model. Recall that the misspecification error is approximately equal toC × dt × p(t, t1) × Q(t, t1) × m(m + 1)/2. The full-coupon recovery model can only exhibit a worse fit if misspecification errors are present. If they are zero, the two models are the same. The misspecification error’s approximation formula is multiplicative in coupon rate, recovery rate, default probability, and maturity. It is useful to note that the approximation is quite accurate in capturing the variation in misspecification errors. When we regress actual on predicted misspecification errors, theR2 lies between 93% and 95%. Table 4 reports summary statistics of model fit, misspecification errors, model outperfor- mance, and", "fication errors, theR2 lies between 93% and 95%. Table 4 reports summary statistics of model fit, misspecification errors, model outperfor- mance, and parameter estimates. The 25th percentile issuer-day misspecification error is 4 cents (the median is 13 cents). Thus, as expected, a large fraction of the data is not greatly affected by the pricing differences between the two models. However, the mean misspecifica- tion error is more than twice as large and equal to 30 cents, which means that there are many bonds with large implied price differences across the two models (when input parameters are held constant). The 95th percentile of the misspecification error distribution is 1.02, which is substantial, and the 75th percentile (unreported) is 0.30, which is also quite large. The median ob", "specification error distribution is 1.02, which is substantial, and the 75th percentile (unreported) is 0.30, which is also quite large. The median observed bond price is equal to 101.33. As a result, these numbers are directly com- parable to those in Table 1. Of course, when estimating the two models separately, which is what we do next, the full-coupon recovery model may adjust parameters, resulting in pos- sible biases. However, as we saw in Section 4, when discussing the bond prices of defaulted companies, an incorrect model not only produces biased parameter estimates, but a worse fit. B. Model Performance 24 Following Bakshi, Madan and Zhang (2006) we report mean absolute pricing error to compare model fit.27 Another alternative could be to measure performance comparing yields or cr", "Zhang (2006) we report mean absolute pricing error to compare model fit.27 Another alternative could be to measure performance comparing yields or credit spreads. We do not choose this route because our analysis of model misspecification errors and our measure of outperformance focuses specifically on dollar pricing errors, not yields. In addition, one contribution of our paper is to point out that yields and credit spreads should not be used to price bonds. As noted previously, if bonds are priced according to the no-coupon recovery model and not the full-coupon recovery model, this has two implications. First, in a sample of bonds that have large default risk, we should detect that the no-coupon recovery model has a better fit. Second, the outperformance will be larger when the two mode", "e large default risk, we should detect that the no-coupon recovery model has a better fit. Second, the outperformance will be larger when the two models disagree by more (i.e. when the misspecification errors are larger and more variable). We next provide evidence supporting both of these implications. We note that there is nothing mechanical about the relation between misspecification errors and model outperformance. If bonds were priced according to the full-coupon recovery model, we would find that it outperforms the no-coupon recovery model, and that it does so by more when differences between model implied prices are larger. Wealsonotethataveragemodeloutperformancemust, necessarily, beafunctionofsample characteristics.

What this implies is that we expect a sample with higher misspecification errors to have higher no-coupon model outperformance. In addition, it implies that we may find low average outperformance for other sample characteristics. This is one reason to focus on explaining variation in model outperformance: to be consistent with the theory, we should find evidence that the no-coupon model outperforms where we expect it to outperform. 1. Model 1: A Fixed Recovery Rate 27Eom, Helwege and Huang (2004) calculate percentage pricing errors, and Bakshi, Madan and Zhang (2006) also report these. In our sample, 90 percent of prices lie between 95.70 and 110.11; results are therefore robust to using percentage errors i", "(2006) also report these. In our sample, 90 percent of prices lie between 95.70 and 110.11; results are therefore robust to using percentage errors instead. 25 We compare the two models after fitting them independently to the data. For each issuer-day, we estimate both the no-coupon and full-coupon recovery models and calculate the volume-weighted mean absolute error. These average error statistics are reported in Table 4 Panel A. As expected, we find that the no-coupon recovery model fits the data better than the full-coupon recovery model. The mean model outperformance is equal to 0.07. However, also as expected, there are many observations for which the error difference is very small (median outperformance is equal to 0.02). At the same time, there are also issuer days with larger pric", "s for which the error difference is very small (median outperformance is equal to 0.02). At the same time, there are also issuer days with larger pricing error differences. The 95th percentile of the outperformance distribution is 0.27. We also report overall model fit – the no-coupon recovery model has an average dollar pricing error of 0.35. What is more relevant for the performance comparison is how the models perform when model prices differ, resulting in misspecification errors. In fact, having a large misspecifica- tion error standard deviation within the data sample is crucial to validating the no-coupon recovery model. When predicted misspecification errors are small, for example because the default probabilities are low, pricing differences will also be small. Reflecting the large", "misspecification errors are small, for example because the default probabilities are low, pricing differences will also be small. Reflecting the large por- tion of the data with low misspecification errors, we see that a large fraction of the data also has a low standard deviation of those errors. The average standard deviation is 26 cents, the median is 12 cents, and the 25th percentile is 3 cents. But, even if predicted misspecification errors are large, the full-coupon recovery model maystillgeneratelowpricingerrors, forexample, ifthebondsinthespecificissuer-daysample have very similar predicted misspecification errors.

But, if there is a high variability in the misspecification errors, the incorrect model will fail to fit prices as well as the no-coupon recovery model. 26 As predicted, we find that the no-coupon recovery model outperformance is large when the misspecification error standard deviation is large. The second set of results in Panel A, first line, is for the subsample of issuer days in the top quartile of the misspecification error standard deviation distribution. In that group, the minimum misspecification error standard deviation is 30 cents and the mean is 75 cents. Correspon", "standard deviation distribution. In that group, the minimum misspecification error standard deviation is 30 cents and the mean is 75 cents. Correspondingly, the outperformance (difference in mean absolute errors across the two models) is much larger, exactly as our model predicts. The average outperformance more than triples to 0.22. Even though we are considering only 25% of issuer days, this sample reflects prices from 51,133 observations, which is 30.4% of observations, or 5.7 observations per issuer-day, compared to 4.7 for the full sample. Breaking up the sample across credit rating groups, we find, as expected, that the mis- specification error increases with rating. The misspecification error increases from 0.10 (AA and above) to 0.94 (BB and below). Correspondingly, model outperfo", "ion error increases with rating. The misspecification error increases from 0.10 (AA and above) to 0.94 (BB and below). Correspondingly, model outperformance increases with rating, from 0.03 (AA and above) to 0.23 (BB and below). The main driver for larger mis- specification errors is a larger annual default probability, which in model 1 is the parameter estimated. It increases from 1.1% (AA and above) to 4.5% (BB and below). These are the parameters for the no-coupon recovery model. When estimating the full-coupon recovery model, estimated default probabilities are larger. If they were not, the full-coupon recovery model would produce prices that are too large on average. We therefore can see the bias introduced when using the misspecified model. Of course, all models are incomplete approx", "that are too large on average. We therefore can see the bias introduced when using the misspecified model. Of course, all models are incomplete approximations of reality and we can also compare the no-coupon recovery model estimates to independently-estimated default probabilities based on historical data, summary statistics for which we report below. Those numbers are lower, mainly because Model 1 assumes no variation in illiquidity. 2. Model 2: A Variable Recovery Rate WenextestimateModel2, whichrelaxestheconstraintontherecoveryrate, butcontinues 27 to estimate implied default probabilities from bond prices. Adding a degree of freedom, we expect the overall fit to increase and the no-coupon recovery model outperformance to decrease, because there are now two parameters also in the full-c", "xpect the overall fit to increase and the no-coupon recovery model outperformance to decrease, because there are now two parameters also in the full-coupon recovery model, both of which can be biased. Indeed, average outperformance is equal to 0.03, but that number approximately triples to 0.10 for the high misspecification standard deviation sample. As before, outperformance increases with credit rating. We also note that average estimated recovery rate is close to 50% (restricted value in Model 1) both for the full sample, as well as for rating subsamples. C. Determinants of the No-coupon Recovery Model’s Outperformance We now explore the determinants of the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance (the difference between the no-coupon and full-coupon model volume-weighted absolute pric", "eterminants of the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance (the difference between the no-coupon and full-coupon model volume-weighted absolute pricing errors). As discussed in Section III, outperformance should be related to the misspecification error – if this error is larger, we expect outperformance of the no-coupon recovery model to be larger as well. Table 5 Panel A reports outperformance for the full sample and several subsamples. In Panel B we regress outperformance on different sets of explanatory variables in order to explore determinants of no-coupon recovery model outperformace. On average, the no-coupon recovery model provides a better fit (also see Table 4). For Model 1, pricing errors are 7.2 cents larger when using the full-coupon recovery model and the difference is stat", "a better fit (also see Table 4). For Model 1, pricing errors are 7.2 cents larger when using the full-coupon recovery model and the difference is statistically significant. We have already seen that the (in)ability of the full-coupon recovery model to fit the data reflects its misspecified assumption. Thus, we expect a strong relation- ship between the no-coupon recovery model outperformance and the misspecification error’s standard deviation. 28 We first focus on the subsample with the top 25% of default probabilities. For that sub- sample, the average outperformance is 19.1 cents, almost three times as large as in the full sample. This outperformance is even larger when considering the subsample with the largest 25% average misspecification error issuer days. Here the outperformance is 2", "erformance is even larger when considering the subsample with the largest 25% average misspecification error issuer days. Here the outperformance is 21.8 cents on average. As expected, the variable finding the largest outperformance is the misspecification error’s standard deviation. It may be large because of a large dispersion in maturities com- bined with large default probabilities. The misspecified full-coupon recovery model does not have sufficient degrees of freedom to match the data well. The no-coupon recovery model has, on average, a 22.4 cent lower pricing error than the full-coupon recovery model. The pattern is the same, only stronger, when examining the pricing errors in the top deciles. For large default probability issuer days the outperformance is equal to 29.5 cents, for", "onger, when examining the pricing errors in the top deciles. For large default probability issuer days the outperformance is equal to 29.5 cents, for the misspecification error it is 35.4 cents and for the standard deviation it is equal to 37.3 cents. Pricing error differences are large when the model predicts them to be large. A similar pattern emerges for Model 2, though pricing error differences are smaller throughout, reflecting the additional degree of freedom (two instead of one fitted model parameter), and resulting potential bias in that model. For the top decile of misspecification error standard deviations, outperformance is on average equal to 16 cents, which is highly statistically significant. We next explore in more detail what determines the size of the no-coupon recovery mo", "age equal to 16 cents, which is highly statistically significant. We next explore in more detail what determines the size of the no-coupon recovery model outperformance. Specifically, we regress pricing error differences on maturity, coupon, and default probabilities. Together with the recovery rate, these four variables are the main determinants of the misspecification error. The recovery rate is fixed in Model 1 and is therefore not included, but we do include it when explaining variation in the outperformance of Model 2. Maturity and the default probability are highly significant with a positive sign; the coupon rate also has a positive sign but is insignificant. All variables enter the misspecification error, but they do so in a specific way. We next 29 include the actual misspecificat", "gn but is insignificant. All variables enter the misspecification error, but they do so in a specific way. We next 29 include the actual misspecification error and the misspecification error standard deviation into the regression. We expect the dispersion of the misspecification errors to determine model outperformance. When we include the misspecification error’s standard deviation, the coefficient on it is highly significant, while the coefficients on all the other variables becomes either indistinguishable from zero or switches sign. TheR2 of the regression increases from 37.1% to 60.6%. Dropping all the other variables and keeping only the misspecification error’s standard deviation in the regression results in a similar fit of 58.4%. The ability of the misspecification error’s standar", "e misspecification error’s standard deviation in the regression results in a similar fit of 58.4%. The ability of the misspecification error’s standard deviation to explain the variation in model outperformance is direct evidence supporting our hypothesis that bond market prices are consistent with the no-coupon recovery model instead of the full-coupon recovery model. When fitting Model 2, the results are very similar. All four variables individually enter with the expected sign. When the misspecification error’s standard deviation is included along with the average misspecification error, the coefficients drop in size by more than half or become negative. As before, the regressionR2 increases dramatically from 18.7% to 41.4% and it is only slightly smaller at 38.2% when only the misspeci", "ecome negative. As before, the regressionR2 increases dramatically from 18.7% to 41.4% and it is only slightly smaller at 38.2% when only the misspecification error’s standard deviation remains in the regression. To summarize, our analysis provides strong evidence that the pricing error differences between the two models are statistically significant for the full sample. Importantly, variation in model outperformance occurs exactly when the model predicts it. This evidence is for a sample consisting of 93.5% investment grade debt (98.7% with a rating of BB+ or above) and thus one where market participants perceive default is not imminent. D. Outperformance Over Time We have documented the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance in the full sample and in sub-samples. We next consider the", "Outperformance Over Time We have documented the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance in the full sample and in sub-samples. We next consider the time variation in its outperformance. Each week 30 we calculate average outperformance and the average misspecification error’s standard devi- ation for all issuer days. Figure 4 plots the time series of the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance based on Model 1. There is some noticeable time variation. Toward the end of 2018 and in the beginning of 2019 the model’s outperformance increases, reaching a local peak of about 11 cents. This episode happened contemporaneously with a stock market downturn and a corresponding increase in volatility and default probabilities. Then, at the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020 we see a large inc", "downturn and a corresponding increase in volatility and default probabilities. Then, at the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020 we see a large increase in model outperformance reaching a weekly average of 37 cents. Toward the end of the sample, in 2022, the average outperformance reaches 24 cents. Note also that average outperformance of the no-coupon recovery model is positive throughout the sample. As reported in Table 5, the misspecification error’s standard deviation explains 58% of the variation in no-coupon recovery model outperformance. Using weekly averages – the data from the figure – results in anR2 of 79%. We note that, during the pandemic, there is a lot of variation in both outperformance and the misspecification error’s standard deviation; during that time the relationshi", "the pandemic, there is a lot of variation in both outperformance and the misspecification error’s standard deviation; during that time the relationship is weaker (R2 of 64%). Figure 5 plots weekly averages outside of 2020. We find a clear linear relation between outperformance and the misspecification error’s standard deviation; the R2 of this relationship is 93%. In short, model outperformance is large when we expect it to be large. For Model 2 the pattern outside of 2020 is very similar even though the average outperfor- mance is lower (see Tables 4 and 5). However, during the height of pandemic (March 2020) the relationship between outperformance and the misspecification error’s standard deviation is no longer present when using Model 2. This may be due to the additional degree of freed", "ormance and the misspecification error’s standard deviation is no longer present when using Model 2. This may be due to the additional degree of freedom in that model and reflects the lower overall no-coupon recovery model outperformance. Using a more constrained model with a historically-estimated default probability and in which we estimate the recovery rate (discussed below) results in a strong relationship between model outperformance and the misspecification error’s standard deviation in 2020. 31 E. Model 3: Using a Historically Estimated Default Probability and an Illiquidity Discount In Models 1 and 2, the default probability is estimated implicitly. We now use historically- estimated default probabilities from a proportional hazard rate model as an input (as dis- cussed in Section", "ted implicitly. We now use historically- estimated default probabilities from a proportional hazard rate model as an input (as dis- cussed in Section 4.1.2). The data are from the Kamakura Risk Information Services (KRIS) division of SAS Institute, Inc. We also allow for an effect of illiquidity (as discussed in Section 2.2). Table 6 reports estimation results. The no-coupon recovery model’s mean average pricing error is equal to 0.29, slightly lower than Model 2. The average misspecification error is equal to 0.21 and the average no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance is 0.02. When focusing on the large misspecification error’s standard deviation subsample the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance more than triples and is equal to 0.07. The median annual default probability used as", "eviation subsample the no-coupon recovery model’s outperformance more than triples and is equal to 0.07. The median annual default probability used asan input to the model is0.7% and the mean is equal to 1.3%.28 We estimate the mean recovery rate as 49%, in line with the restriction in Model 1 and the mean recovery rate in Model 2. The mean illiquidity parameter is -0.4%. It is useful to note that both the recovery rate and illiquidity estimates are reasonable. This is, of course, not guaranteed given that our estimates are implicitly estimated using the traded bond prices and the no-coupon recovery model. Jankowitsch, Nagler, and Subrahmanyam (2014) report an average recovery rate value of 0.38. Since our recovery rate is in fact the recovery rate futures price, as shown in the online app", "m (2014) report an average recovery rate value of 0.38. Since our recovery rate is in fact the recovery rate futures price, as shown in the online appendix, it is expected that our estimate should be slightly larger than these estimates. In Panel A we report full-sample illiquidity estimates of 0.26% (median) and 0.42% (mean). Though somewhat lower, these are broadly consistent with, for example, the spread between Aaa-rated corporate bonds and Treasury 28These probabilities lie below estimated default probabilities in Models 1 and 2. Those measures are higher because we do not include an illiquidity discount in those models. 32 debt.

F. Time Variation in Parameter Estimates We next study the illiquidity and recovery rate parameter estimates over time. Before proceeding, it is useful to get a sense of what kind of variation is present in the default probabilities (which are an input to the model). Figure 6 reports monthly average default probabilities over the sample period. Two important drivers of default probabilities are volatility and leverage (see, e.g., Merton (1974), Jarrow (2009), Guha, Sbuelz, and Tarelli (2020)), which we also plot. Variation in default probabilities over time are dominated by the effect of the pandemic in 2020. It is also notable that variatio", "which we also plot. Variation in default probabilities over time are dominated by the effect of the pandemic in 2020. It is also notable that variation in default probabilities is tracked by variation in stock return volatility, while book leverage remains close to constant throughout the sample period. Figure 7 plots weekly average illiquidity, based on the full estimation sample (Table 6). We notice a slight increase in late 2018 and early 2019. The more striking and larger increase in the estimated illiquidity parameter occurs at the beginning of the pandemic. Average illiquidity increases to just under 3%. This increase is matched by an increase in the Aaa-Treasury spread, which we also plot in the figure. We interpret the Aaa-Treasury spread as a related measure of illiquidity. Indeed", "ncrease in the Aaa-Treasury spread, which we also plot in the figure. We interpret the Aaa-Treasury spread as a related measure of illiquidity. Indeed, as is evident from the figure, the two series move together; the correlation is equal to 65% (in levels, 79% in changes). The close relationship between the Aaa-Treasury spread provides independent validation of our model and its implied corporate bond illiquidity measure. There is also considerable variation in the illiquidity parameter across ratings. Figure 8 shows the weekly average illiquidity discounts at a monthly frequency across rating groups, again based on the full estimation sample.

The three investment grade groups have some- 33 what similar illiquidity levels, while the non-investment grade’s group has noticeably larger illiquidity and is also less correlated with the other three groups.29 The average recovery rates over time are plotted in Figure 9. The fact that there is no recovery of coupons in the event of default means that recovery rates can be inferred directly from bond prices. This is an important empirical novelty compared to an inability todisentanglerecoveryratesanddefaultprobabilitiesifequalseniorityisassumedforcoupons and principal, and there is a single spread used to discount all cash flows. There is not much variation over time, supporting the assumption of a fixed recovery rate in Model 1.

Indeed, there is also little variation in average recovery rate across rating groups (Table 6 Panel B). We can use these estimates to interpret what happened during the height of the COVID pandemic. Figure 10 plots weekly averages of recovery rates and illiquidity parameters in 2020. From Figure 6 we already know that the historically estimated default probabilities increased dramatically in early 2020. We can now see that there was also a dramatic increase in illiquidity, from an average of 0.18% in January to a maximum of 2.8% in the second half of March. There is a modest increase in recovery rates from close to 55% in January to 68% in March, perhaps due to an increased market focus on short-t", "March. There is a modest increase in recovery rates from close to 55% in January to 68% in March, perhaps due to an increased market focus on short-term liquidity-induced defaults, which may have been perceived to result in slightly lower levels of loss in the event of default. Bond prices can decline either because of higher default probabilities, lower recovery rates, or higher illiquidity. Our estimates suggest that, at least during March of 2020, the two main effects were a loss of liquidity and an increase in default probabilities. G. Out-of-sample Model Performance Our analysis so far is based on fitting the pricing model in-sample. A concern is that in- sample model fit statistics can be biased by overfitting noise in the data. To address this issue, 29Investment grade illiquidity", "concern is that in- sample model fit statistics can be biased by overfitting noise in the data. To address this issue, 29Investment grade illiquidity averages lie below the Aaa-Treasury spread (see Table 6) suggesting that, although the two measures are highly correlated in levels and changes, they do not capture exactly the same market friction. 34 our focus was on relative performance. We measured if the no-coupon model had a lower overall error as compared to the full-coupon recovery model. Both models have the same number of parameters and a similar structure. Unless we believe that there is a differential bias in the model fit statistics, our measure of outperformance should not be affected by the in-sample methodology. Nevertheless, it is useful to check relative model performance us", ", our measure of outperformance should not be affected by the in-sample methodology. Nevertheless, it is useful to check relative model performance using an out-of-sample pricing approach as well. Each issuer day, we split the sample of bonds into two groups of equal or close to equal size (if there are an odd number of observations, one group will be slightly larger than the other). One group is the estimation sample that is used to calculate the models’ parameters – default probability, recovery rate, and illiquidity. We take these estimated parameters and compute fitted prices for the other group’s observations, the out- of-sample group. We fit both the full and the no-coupon recovery model in this way.

In order to ensure that we can estimate the parameters in this manner, we restrict attention to issuer days with at least four observations; that way each group always contains at least two observations. We repeat the process but switching the observation groups so that the second group of bonds on that issuer day (that we previously used for out-of-sample fitting) is now used for estimation purposes. In this way, when calculating each bond price, we are using parameters that are estimated using a different sample (on the same day, but including different bonds), while at the same time ensuring that we can work with a large data set of out-of-sample model prices.

We report full-sample no-coupon recovery model outperformance as well as outperformance for the sample with large misspecification error standard deviations. Table 7 Panel A reports summary statistics. All three models show the no-coupon recovery model outperformance and in each case the magnitude of the outperformance increases substantially for the sample with large misspec- 35 ification error standard deviation observations.

We find that average outperformance is highly statistically different from zero (Panel B) for all three models and for the full sample as well as the large misspecification error standard deviation subsamples. Panel C reports average outperformance across rating groups. As the credit rat- ing increases, the no-coupon recovery model outperformance increases also, consistent with the in-sample estimation results.

We calculate misspecification errors – those resulting from using the full-coupon recovery model rather than the no-coupon recovery model.

The model has a clear prediction when no recovery on coupons after default is relevant for pricing and when it is less important.

We find evidence supporting this prediction, while also identifying our model’s outperformance in the full sample. We document that model outperformance is closely related to the misspecification er- ror’s standard deviation within the estimation sample (generally an issuer-day). When that standard deviation is large, our model predicts that bond prices will be the most affected by the erroneous assumption of full-coupon recovery after default. The fact that the misspecifi- cation error’s standard deviation explains model outperformance well is thus direct evidence supporting the no-coupon recovery model. Separately, we find that the no-coupon recovery outperformance is evident when considering bond prices of companies in bankruptcy. Model outperformance is al", "ely, we find that the no-coupon recovery outperformance is evident when considering bond prices of companies in bankruptcy. Model outperformance is also higher for non-investment grade issuers. Finally, our model allows for direct estimation of implied recovery rates and an illiquid- ity parameter’s effects on bond prices. Average recovery rates, though a little higher, are generally in line and consistent with the previous literature. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit markets in March of 2020, both the Aaa-Treasury and our illiquidity parameter spiked (also see Kargar et al. (2021)). In the crisis, default probabilities increased, bond prices dropped, and illiquidity increased markedly. Indeed, we find that variation in our illiquidity parameter has a strikingly close relationship to the Aaa", "ropped, and illiquidity increased markedly. Indeed, we find that variation in our illiquidity parameter has a strikingly close relationship to the Aaa-Treasury spread, a standard measure of corporate bond illiquidity. The close relationship between the two measures, neither of which uses the same data nor methodology to compute, provides independent validation for 37 our pricing model.

Internet Appendix 1. The Bond Valuation Formula This appendix formalizes the pricing model in Section 3. We consider a continuous trading model on a finite horizon[0, T∗]. The uncertainty in the model is characterized by a complete filtered probability space (Ω, F, (Ft)t∈[0,T∗], P)", "ading model on a finite horizon[0, T∗]. The uncertainty in the model is characterized by a complete filtered probability space (Ω, F, (Ft)t∈[0,T∗], P) where the filtration (Ft)t∈[0,T∗] satisfies the usual hypotheses andF = FT∗. See Protter (2005) for the definitions of these various terms. Here P is the statistical probability measure. The default-free money market account earns interest continuously at the default-free spot rate of interest,rt, which is adapted to(Ft)t∈[0,T∗]. As in the text, money market account’s time t value is Bt = e R t 0 rsds. Of course, we assume the necessary measurability and integrability such that the following expression is well-defined. The default-free zero-coupon bond, denoted by p(t, T) > 0, is adapted to(Ft)t∈[0,T∗]. We consider a firm that issues a bond", "pression is well-defined. The default-free zero-coupon bond, denoted by p(t, T) > 0, is adapted to(Ft)t∈[0,T∗]. We consider a firm that issues a bond with a coupon ofC dollars, a face value equal to L dollars, and a maturity dateT. The bond pays theC dollar coupons at intermediate dates {t1, ..., tm = T}, but only up to the default timeτ. For notational convenience, let the current timet = t0. If default happens in the time interval(tk−1, tk], then the bond pays a stochastic recovery rate ofδtk ∈ [0, 1] at timetk on the notional ofL dollars. It is important to note that default can happen anytime within this interval, but the payment only occurs at the end. If default does not happen, the face value ofL dollars is repaid at timeT. 1 Let Γt = (Γ1(t), . . . ,Γn(t))′ ∈ Rn be a collection of s", "urs at the end. If default does not happen, the face value ofL dollars is repaid at timeT. 1 Let Γt = (Γ1(t), . . . ,Γn(t))′ ∈ Rn be a collection of stochastic processes characterizing the state of the firm and the market at timet with FΓ t representing the filtration generated by the state variablesΓt up to and including timet ≥ 0. We assume that these state variables are adapted toFt, which implies thatFΓ t ⊂ Ft. We assume thatrt is FΓ t - measurable. Let λ : [0, T∗] × Rn −→ [0, ∞), denoted λt = λt(Γt) ≥ 0, be jointly Borel measurable with RT∗ 0 λt(Γt)dt < ∞ a.s. P, and let Nt ∈ {0, 1, 2, ···} with N0 = 0 be a Cox process conditioned on FΓ T with λt(Γt) its intensity process (see Lando (1998)). Finally, let the default timeτ ∈ [0, T∗] be the stopping time adapted to the filtrationFt defi", "T with λt(Γt) its intensity process (see Lando (1998)). Finally, let the default timeτ ∈ [0, T∗] be the stopping time adapted to the filtrationFt defined by τ ≡ inf {t >0 : Nt = 1}. The functionλt(Γt) is the firm’s default intensity. A Cox process is a point process which, conditional upon the information set generated by the state variables processΓt over the entire trading horizon[0, T∗] behaves like a standard Poisson process. In particular, P(τ >T FΓ T∗ ∨ Ft ) = e− R T t λudu and P(τ >T |Ft ) = EP h e− R T t λudu |Ft i . We assume that the markets are arbitrage-free. Assumption.

Given an equivalent martingale measureQ, define eλt ≡ λtκt to be the intensity process of the Cox process underQ where κt(ω) ≥ 0 is a predictable process with RT∗ 0 λt(Γt)κtdt < ∞ a.s. P (see Bremaud (1980), p. 167). The process κt(ω) represents a default jump risk premium. We add the following assumption to simplify the analytic formulas. Assumption.

Thus, the previous equation simplifies to vt = Lp(t, T) [1− Q(t, T)] + (C − Ldt) Pm k=1 p(t, tk) [1− Q(t, tk)] +Ldt Pm k=1 p(t, tk) [1− Q(t, tk−1)] 3 where dt = EQ [δτ |Ft ] Proof.

To simplify expression (??), we introduce two simple credit derivatives: a survival and default digital. These building blocks were first discussed in the literature by Madan and Udal (1998). At timet, consider the time interval[tk−1, tk] for k = 0, . . . , m. Note that", "blocks were first discussed in the literature by Madan and Udal (1998). At timet, consider the time interval[tk−1, tk] for k = 0, . . . , m. Note that whenk = m, tm = T. We define a survival and a default digital as follows • (A Survival Digital) This security pays $1 at timetk only if default occurs aftertk. The value of this security at timet < tk is z(t, tk) = EQ h 1{τ>tk}e− R tk t rudu |Ft i . • (A Default Digital) This security pays $1 at timetk if default occurs within(tk−1, tk]. The value of this security at timet < tk is x(t, tk) = EQ h 1{tk−1<τ≤tk}e− R tk s rudu |Ft i . 4 Using the conditional independence assumption, we can write these as z(t, tk) = p(t, tk)[1 − Q(t, tk)] and x(t, tk) = p(t, tk)[Q(t, tk+1) − Q(t, tk)]. The identity1{tk−1<τ} = 1{tk−1<τ≤tk} + 1{τ>tk} implies EQ h 1", "ese as z(t, tk) = p(t, tk)[1 − Q(t, tk)] and x(t, tk) = p(t, tk)[Q(t, tk+1) − Q(t, tk)]. The identity1{tk−1<τ} = 1{tk−1<τ≤tk} + 1{τ>tk} implies EQ h 1{tk−1<τ}e− R tk s rudu |Ft i = EQ h 1{τ≤tk}e− R tk s rudu |Ft i +EQ h 1{τ>tk}e− R tk s rudu |Ft i , which simplifies to the given expression: p(t, tk)[1 − Q(t, tk−1)] = x(t, tk) + z(t, tk). The left side represents the present value of thetk maturity zero-coupon bond at timet, which is received only if there is no default before or at timetk−1. The right side is the present value of the default digital for the interval(tk−1, tk] and the survival digital with maturity tk. Using these two digitals, the valuation expression can be written as vt = Pm k=1 Cz(t, tk) + Lz(t, T) +Ldt Pm k=1 x(t, tk). This expression shows that a risky coupon bond can", ", the valuation expression can be written as vt = Pm k=1 Cz(t, tk) + Lz(t, T) +Ldt Pm k=1 x(t, tk). This expression shows that a risky coupon bond can always be decomposed into a portfolio of survival and default digitals. 5 2. The Recovery Rate Futures Price This section explains whydt can be interpreted as a futures price. Define dt := EQ [δT∗ |Ft ] for t ∈ [0, T∗] where δT∗ corresponds to the recovery rate if default happens at timeT∗. That this can be interpreted as a futures price follows from the commodities pricing literature (for example see Jarrow (2021), chapter 6). Sincedt is aQ− martingale, the recovery rate futures price is equal to dt = EQ [δτ |Ft ] , which is the risk adjusted expected value of the recovery rate at the default timeτ. The relation between the recovery rate pr", "to dt = EQ [δτ |Ft ] , which is the risk adjusted expected value of the recovery rate at the default timeτ. The relation between the recovery rate processδt and the futures pricedt is given by the following expression δt = dtEQ \u0014Bt Bτ |Ft \u0015 . Proof. Define the recovery rate processδt on [0, T∗] as the liquidation value of the firm at timet. Using the notation in the text, the following time line documents relevant dates. 0 ··· t ··· tk τ ··· tk+1 ··· τ∗ ··· T∗ default payment (d0, δ0) ( dt, δt) ( dτ , δτ ) ( dτ∗, δτ∗) ( dT∗ = δT∗) Both τ and τ∗ are stopping times withτ∗ > τ. τ is the firm’s default time. Due to cross- defaulting provisions, if one liability defaults, all default at the same time.τ∗ corresponds to the date the payments on all of the firm’s liabilities are paid, after liqui", "if one liability defaults, all default at the same time.τ∗ corresponds to the date the payments on all of the firm’s liabilities are paid, after liquidation or financial restructuring. It occurs, as indicated, after the default date. TimeT∗ is when the model 6 ends. The arbitrage free value of the recovery rate payment at timet ∈ [0, T∗] is δt = EQ \u0014 δT∗ BT∗ |Ft \u0015 Bt. Using iterated expectations, we obtain δt = EQ \u0014 δτ Bτ |Ft \u0015 Bt. Under the conditional independence ofδt and rt, we can rewrite this as δt = EQ \u0014 EQ [δτ |Ft ∨ τ ] EQ \u0014Bt Bτ |Ft ∨ τ \u0015 |Ft \u0015 = MX i=1 EQ [δti |Ft; ti−1 < τ≤ ti ] EQ \u0014Bti Bτ |Ft; ti−1 < τ≤ ti \u0015 Prob Q [ti−1 < τ≤ ti |Ft ] = MX i=1 EQ [δti |Ft; ti−1 < τ≤ ti ] EQ \u0014Bti Bτ |Ft; ti−1 < τ≤ ti \u0015 [Q(t, ti) − Q(t, ti−1)] where tM = T∗ and Q(t, ti) = EQ [1τ≤ti |Ft ] = Prob Q", "Ft ] = MX i=1 EQ [δti |Ft; ti−1 < τ≤ ti ] EQ \u0014Bti Bτ |Ft; ti−1 < τ≤ ti \u0015 [Q(t, ti) − Q(t, ti−1)] where tM = T∗ and Q(t, ti) = EQ [1τ≤ti |Ft ] = Prob Q [τ ≤ ti |Ft ]. Recall that all payments occur at the next payment date after default. Using the conditional independence ofδt and rt from τ, we can rewrite this as δt = MX i=1 EQ [δti |Ft ] EQ \u0014 Bt Bti |Ft \u0015 [Q(t, ti) − Q(t, ti−1)] . Last, using the definition ofdt and noting thatEQ h Bt Bti |Ft i = p(t, ti) we get δt = dt MX i=1 p(t, ti) [Q(t, ti) − Q(t, ti−1)] . 7 We note that this implies δt = dtEQ \u0014Bt Bτ |Ft \u0015 . End of proof. Given this expression, it is easily seen that the recovery rate futures price is strictly greater than the recovery rateδt since EQ h Bt Bτ |Ft i < 1. This difference is expected to be small since interest rates are", "utures price is strictly greater than the recovery rateδt since EQ h Bt Bτ |Ft i < 1. This difference is expected to be small since interest rates are small over our sample period. 3. Misspecification Error Approximation In the event of default, the present value of the payoff for the first coupon is equal to the discounted value of the product of the coupon rate, the recovery value, and the probability of default, i.e.Cdtp(t, t1)Q(t, t1). For the second coupon, default can occur either in the first or in the second period. The present value of the payoff in period one is the same as for the first coupon. The conditional expectation at time one of the payoff in period two is also the same as for the first coupon. However, this payment still needs to be discounted back to time zero and adju", "ne of the payoff in period two is also the same as for the first coupon. However, this payment still needs to be discounted back to time zero and adjusted to take into account that the firm must have survived to period one. For longer time periods, a similar logic applies. This implies that the misspecification error is exactly proportional to the product of the coupon payment and the recovery value. In contrast, the total misspecification error is only approximately proportional to the error resulting from the first coupon. The reason is that the probability of survival depends on the default probability and because payments farther into the future will be discounted by a larger amount. Next we consider the effect of the bond’s maturity or, equivalently, the number of coupon payments. Ign", "future will be discounted by a larger amount. Next we consider the effect of the bond’s maturity or, equivalently, the number of coupon payments. Ignoring discounting and the adjustment for the probability of survival, the ex- pected recovery payment from the second coupon is twice as large as for the first coupon. The reason is that default on the second coupon can happen either in the first or the second period. For a bond receivingm coupon payments the factor is thereforem(m + 1)/2. This 8 means that the approximate total error is equal toCdtp(t, t1)Q(t, t1)m(m + 1)/2. 4. Robustness Tests This section provides several robustness tests of the model’s outperformance. 1. Errors and Biased Parameter Estimates in the Full-Coupon Recovery model: A Quasi-Simulation Another way to check that o", "the model’s outperformance. 1. Errors and Biased Parameter Estimates in the Full-Coupon Recovery model: A Quasi-Simulation Another way to check that our results are due to the misspecified assumptions underlying the full-coupon recovery model is to calculate pricing errors using a simulation. We do this using the actual data as the basis for a quasi-simulation. Specifically, we assume that the no-coupon recovery model’s parameters are unbiased and calculate market prices based on that model. We then use the full-coupon recovery model to price these bonds. This enables us to trace out the effects of using the full-coupon recovery model’s misspecified assumptions on model prices and parameters. We find that the expected biases appear. The misspecification error’s standard deviation is closel", "ecified assumptions on model prices and parameters. We find that the expected biases appear. The misspecification error’s standard deviation is closely related to the pricing error. Thus, whenever the full-coupon recovery model has more difficulty using the parameters to fit the data, the no-coupon recovery model’s outper- formance is larger, just as we observed in the main sample. We also find that the full-coupon recovery parameter estimates are indeed biased relative to the no-coupon recovery model’s parameters, which in this exercise are assumed to be the actual underlying parameters. In Model 1 the default probability has a downward bias; the effect is similar to what we see in the main sample. In Model 3 the recovery rate has a downward bias, as we would expect. The full-coupon recov", "; the effect is similar to what we see in the main sample. In Model 3 the recovery rate has a downward bias, as we would expect. The full-coupon recovery model’s estimated recovery rate is 3% lower for the full sample and 4.5% lower for the subsample with the highest quartile of the misspecification error’s standard deviation. For the illiquidity parameter the effect is much smaller. For the full sample, the bias is equal to 0.02% (full-coupon model-implied illiquidity is more negative), while it is 0.06% for the top 25% of the misspecification error’s standard deviation 9 subsample. In short, the patterns we find in the data are directly driven by the full-coupon model’s assumptions. For Model 2, the biases are larger. The recovery rate is 28% too large, while the default probabilities ar", "ven by the full-coupon model’s assumptions. For Model 2, the biases are larger. The recovery rate is 28% too large, while the default probabilities are on average 1.4% too large. This model’s instability underscores the need for more restricted models, namely Model 1 (restricted recovery rate) and Model 3 (historically- estimated default probabilities). 2. Daily Observation Cutoffs In our estimation, we group bonds each issuer day and then fit the two pricing models. We require a minimum of two bond price observations for each issuer day. Another possibility is to choose minimum observation cutoffs, for example requiring at least five or ten observations for each issuer day. Such a restriction has the benefit of reducing noise but shrinks the sample size. We have checked that our results a", "observations for each issuer day. Such a restriction has the benefit of reducing noise but shrinks the sample size. We have checked that our results are robust to increasing the minimum required number of observations.1 3. Monthly Observations An alternative way to reduce noise is to pool observations each issuer month rather than each issuer day. This approach significantly increases the number of observations in each group. It also has the benefit of not reducing the overall sample size. Our results are robust to this change too. In particular, we see a similar level of outperformance of the no-coupon recovery model, though both models fit less well since there is now less parameter flexibility. Our findings suggest that outperformance is not directly linked to sample size. This result i", "less well since there is now less parameter flexibility. Our findings suggest that outperformance is not directly linked to sample size. This result is consistent with our findings that the misspecification error’s variance explains well the variation in model outperformance. 4. Alternative Recovery Rate Estimation Bounds 1In the case of Model 3, the no-coupon recovery model outperformance increases substantially when restricting attention to the sub-sample of issuer days with ten or more observations; however it cuts the number of issuers to only 18. 10 As pointed out, our data set contains a lot of financial institutions, partly because they issue a lot of debt, which is then actively traded in the secondary market. Regulated financial institutions may have higher recovery rates than oth", "y issue a lot of debt, which is then actively traded in the secondary market. Regulated financial institutions may have higher recovery rates than other firms since the regulator may close or seize the bank before losses increase. It is therefore possible that, for at least a subset of the data, recovery rates lie above the 80% cutoff we impose. We have checked what happens if we increase the upper bound on recovery rate to 95%. This increased flexibility may or may not be useful for Model 2, which, as we have discussed, is quite flexible already. However, we may see an effect for Model 3, and that is indeed what we find. No-coupon recovery model outperformance is higher for both models. This evidence suggests that for a subsample of the data issuers have high expected levels of recovery r", "odel outperformance is higher for both models. This evidence suggests that for a subsample of the data issuers have high expected levels of recovery rates. When using this less restrictive estimation for the out-of-sample estimation, Model 2 outperformance drops while Model 3 outperformance increases. This evidence supports our conjecture that Model 2 is somewhat unstable, while it supports the use of restrictions (Models 1 and 3). 11"]
